I've worked for governments, businesses, and even done some bits of work for the World Bank. I also just got back from a course on international standards in regulatory analysis. This should get you started on how to tear apart any new regulation or law.   I'm referencing my documents and notes that I took while taking this international course taught by European professors of public policy, World Bank leaders, and regulatory consultants.   A full outline of the current ideal policy development process can be found here. This is the process that is followed in many Western countries to varying degrees of quality and depth. It's frequently not followed for laws, but it makes a useful tool for tearing them apart.   The UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, EU, and other countries, regularly produce IA statements for new regulations, so you can see their whole process.   The first question that needs to be asked every single time you look at a policy or law and above all before anything else is:  What is the problem?   A policy should always clearly lay out exactly what the problem is and what are the root causes of the problem. Is it too many people are dying in road accidents? Businesses are unable to compete in a specific market? Too many people are getting sick from tainted food?   It's critical that the problem is defined as an adverse affect on people (bad health outcomes, lower wages/wealth, etc).   Mindbogglingly, the problem that the policy is trying to solve is sometimes not clearly defined at all, or even worse the problem as its defined is that there is no policy.   Second, you should look at the objective of the policy. The policy should draw a very clear relationship between the problem, the causes of the problem, and the objective of the policy. Do the objectives of the policy actually line up with the identified problem and causes? Again, you would be surprised how often this isn't true.   Consider a law/policy to increase drug possession penalties:  Too many people are sick or injured from doing recreational drugs, because access to drugs is too easy, because recreational drugs aren't illegal enough. Is this link actually well identified? Is it supported by evidence at all?   So, if the problem is well-defined and the objectives of the policy make sense then you get to look at possible options. Have the policy makers identified a wide range of policy options? Honestly, this basically never happens. Departments and ministries are often constrained to their mandate and other laws, so broader, more effective policies are often completely ignored. Many policies are written with the policy option in mind, so this step is ignored completely. Think of a law that increases penalties for drug possession (e.g. more jail time).   The problem is that many adverse health outcomes are the result of some recreational drug use. Governments almost universally just look at increasing penalties for drug possession or trafficking, but its really obvious that they should at least consider other policy options. Why not treat more drug addicts to reduce the impact on human health? Why not spend more educating people on adverse health effects?  Okay, so let's say that now we have a problem, objectives to fix the problem, and a number of solutions. If the policy makes sense so far, it's actually doing better than most. But now, the policy makers need to convince you that they've properly captured and weighed all of the benefits and costs of the policy options. There are lots of possible questions here:   How sound is the analysis? Was their any analysis at all? Are there lots of unverified assumptions? Are all stakeholders considered? (A stakeholder is any person, industry, or economic actor that may be affected by the policy) Is the analysis transparent enough to know how they weighed the costs and benefits? Did the policy makers undertake sufficient public consultation? Are all of the costs and benefits properly accounted for? Etc.  Honestly, this part of regulatory development is an art into itself. Just weighing the costs and benefits of a new law or regulation can be extremely challenging.   For lots of regulations, you can actually look at all of these things through the impact assessment documents.  Next, did the policy makers choose the right option given their analysis? It should be absolutely crystal clear from their analysis. For many laws, there is no analysis or more frequently only closed-door consultations. Policy makers often do not provide sufficient rational at all for their final option, and do not make even the most basic results from consultations public.   So, even if the government has a policy. How will the government enforce the policy? Obviously a new regulation or law needs someone to make sure people/businesses comply. Also, are the results of the policy/law going to be tracked to see if its effective? Will the policy be scrapped if it's found to be costly and ineffective?  So let's say that increasing recreational drug penalties is a legitimate option. How will the government actually enforce this? Make more jail space? increase police budgets? Is the government going to see if it's an effective policy and drop it if it isn't?   ----------------------------------  As you can probably imagine, most laws, even in well-developed countries, will abysmally fail a lot of these questions.

I have actually spent a lot of time trying to find a book on it, but I have not come across one that is *specifically* about Sociology or Psychology.   I first started to think about this when I was getting my masters degree (in Sociology). Often times I was super excited to share the things I would learn with my family and friends, and how the things I was (and still am) learning are often in contradiction to the things I was told/learned growing up. For context, I'm a white girl who grew up in an upper-middle class politically conservative suburb in a large city with successful parents, and I was always given everything I wanted/needed. I considered myself a Christian and I told people that I was a republican (although I knew nothing about politics and was just identifying with my parents).   Then I started studying Soci and my entire perspective on the world changed. It opened my eyes and forced me to look beyond my tunnel vision of society. It was really hard at times to come to terms with things that I thought I already understood, especially social issues that I had never thought about before or issues that had always been presented to me in a one-sided, biased manner.  A good example of this is the trope of the Welfare Queen. I was told that poor people, esp. poor black people, were moochers and only wanted handouts because they were lazy and didn't want to get a job. Of course, I learned that the Welfare Queen (and welfare \"fraud\") is a myth that was promulgated by Ronald Regan in order to stigmatize people in poverty so that he could convince Americans that rolling back the social safety net was justified because it was only being used by poor black (read: undeserving) citizens. The truth is that most people on welfare *do* have jobs (i.e. the 'working poor'). Also, the welfare reforms of 1996 created a 5-year maximum lifetime cap on benefits so that welfare \"cheaters\" (which did not exist anywhere near the level that we're often told) were literally unable to collect benefits for life (also, contrary to popular opinion, women do not have more babies to get more benefits. In fact, if a woman has a child *while* receiving benefits, she and her family will be removed from the rolls). Welfare is probably one of the least understood/mischaracterized social issue in American society.   Science in general is often met with the sting of anti-intellectualism, which is part of the answer to your question. However, I think *social* science in particular gets it worse than the 'natural' sciences like Biology and Chemistry. I used to say that it was because people were generally more suspect of social sciences, but I think it's more than that. People like to dismiss facts about social issues that they don't agree with or have a different view on because it's much easier to disagree that we live in a post-racial society (we don't) than it is to disagree on the functions of bodily organs. People also tend to conflate their individual life experiences with overall reality (i.e. \"well, i've never experienced blank] so it must not be true or its exaggerated\" or \"well, I know someone who is [blank] but [blank] doesn't happen to them\"). You get what I am saying here? Most people don't question or critically think about social norms or commonsense 'truths' because these 'truths' are so embedded in our milieu that its hard to imagine otherwise. So instead of thinking critically, people dismiss sociological knowledge as either \"elitist\" or \"not real science\" so that they can remain undisturbed in their own little worlds.   Once I saw a question on r/askreddit that asked what the slogan of your college major or job would be. I would say, \"Sociology: reminding people of uncomfortable truths since 1838\" or \"Sociology: everything you were taught about society was a big lie\" lol.

Now I've been thinking about social networks and virtual communities for a long time. Recently I had a debate with a friend about the development of Facebook, and how it may eventually fade away. Our conclusion was that moves away from FB by users could be modeled by accounting for the following variables (applicable to those who are currently on FB):  1. The relative \"entrenchment\" of users - time on the website overall, average time weekly spent, amount of information posted (storage in bytes, mb, or gb).  2. The number of people they have \"friended\" who are heavy content creators (invocation of the supposed 1% rule.)  3. The number of strong relationships maintained through FB.  Now this is nothing academic - we didn't base our **very** rough \"model\" on previous studies, or collected data. We were just shooting the shit! The next day, I see this above article and I found it very interesting - these folks are taking a virus-spread epidemiological model (much more firmly established than conversation over beers). According to their lit review, application of the SIR model can be applied using Google Trends data to monitor and predict the relative life of a disease. In this instance, Facebook is the disease, and they want to use Google Trend data to predict its life.  They then go on to validate this approach by applying it to MySpace which has, as they argue, a \"..full life cycle.\" I love elegant, simple models - they tend to have broader reliability than adding in all the variables I suggested above. However this approach to me is reminiscent of the invasion-succession model in social ecology (adopted, of course, from biological life sciences). The model has some broad applications, but seems to lack nuance - showing weakness especially with regards to matters like gentrification and some rental patterns.  So, to the thoughts/questions I have for discussion: Is applying the SIR (their method specifically called irSIR) going to be a useful method for roughly estimating the life cycles of virtual social networks? What instances are there where this method may fall flat? Can this model be adjusted to incorporate \"stability\" effectively, or does its reliance on Search Trend Data limit its effectiveness? By stability, I am thinking of MySpace - it's still around, not nearly as big, but has a user population (no idea how static that number is, or how we would capably capture that). Does the irSIR model misleadingly suggest that the disease is more or less gone which in fact it is still around?  Finally, on theory nuance - predicting social diseases like FB (I'm sorry for the narrative language on this one, I admit to thinking of social developments as spreading viruses both funny but accurate on some level) - can a social disease like FB achieve a lot of saturation but maintain relatively high stability? For example, if the majority of 30+ users currently on FB **largely** maintain their presence for the next 20 years or so (controlling for attrition through natural processes), would the irSIR model still be useful in predicting its decline? It seems to rely on search trend data, so my thinking is not necessarily. In this instance, it seems like a more nuanced, researched model may yield broader insights into the spread of the disease itself.  Any thoughts on the irSIR model applied to FB would be appreciated. Ideas on how we could more capably model life cycle patterns in virtual communities in general would also be great."}, {"prefer": "In a more eli5 vein… the moon is 30 earths away from the earth.

Liberalism is therefore a response to the political, but it can never realize its own project  Despite the fact Schmitt's critique here was itself an ironically liberal critique (read Strauss' notes for this),  the Left is valorizing the political as a response to what they believe is the inadequacy of liberal politics.

The difference is in how the carrier wave is modulated, or altered. With AM radio, the amplitude, or overall strength, of the signal is varied to incorporate the sound information. With FM, the frequency (the number of times each second that the current changes direction) of the carrier signal is varied.  FM signals have a great advantage over AM signals.

Meanwhile, an emergency use authorization slims down the red tape while still requiring a proven safety and efficacy record.   **ETA:** If normal FDA approval is like a 300-guest wedding event, then emergency use authorization is a small courthouse wedding six months in advance of the main event so that they can file joint taxes and one spouse can technically be on the other's health insurance and dental.   ---  Right now the FDA has cleared just three of many vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J) for use via Emergency Use Authroization (EUA). To get there, they had to go through three phases, and at each stage demonstrate both a) effectiveness and b) safety.   - Phase 1: given to a small number of healthy people to see if it's safe at various doses and prompts an immune response (if OK, move to 2) - Phase 2: given to hundreds of people, randomized and controlled, to see short term side effects and immune response at varying doses (if no major short term side effects, move to 3) - Phase 3: given to thousands of people to measure effectiveness and more safety information vs. a placebo  >For an EUA to be issued for a vaccine, for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure quality and consistency, FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine.  > From a safety perspective, FDA expects an **EUA submission will include all safety data accumulated from phase 1 and 2 studies conducted with the vaccine, with an expectation that phase 3 data will include a median follow-up of at least 2-months** (meaning that at least half of vaccine recipients in phase 3 clinical trials have at least 2 months of follow-up) after completion of the full vaccination regimen. In addition, FDA expects that an EUA request will include a phase 3 safety database of well over 3,000 vaccine recipients, representing a high proportion of participants enrolled in the phase 3 study, who have been followed for serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest for at least one month after completion of the full vaccination regimen.  So far only 3 have made it to EUA. **That means we know it works, we know *for sure* it's safe in the short term, and we know it's manufactured correctly and consistently.** You have a vaccine, you proved it works, and you proved it's safe - you can produce it while you go through the rest of the slow-on-purpose process.  Now to have full approval, and under normal circumstances, the vaccine makers have to get full approval through a **Biologics License Application (BLA)** submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. This is a 3-stage process.  The BLA application itself includes:  - Applicant information  - Product/Manufacturing information  - Pre-clinical studies  - Clinical studies  - Labeling  1. They schedule a bioresearch monitoring inspection. FDA comes out to inspect the production process and facilities.  2. Then they file a Form FDA 356th which includes:  - A summary of information submitted as part of the application.  - Information on the applicant submitting the biologics license application.  - A preclinical data section.  - A clinical data section that includes safety and efficacy data on the product.  - Draft labeling of the product to be licensed.  - Information on the manufacturing, chemistry, and controls of the product.  - A data summary of validation of important processes and assays involved in the manufacture of the product.  - A description of the facility where the product is manufactured.  - Case report form tabulations on the manufacturer’s clinical experience with the product.  - Case report forms and serious event narratives.  - An index.  3.

Also it needs to be of a good enough quality to be ageable; cheese graders pull sample plugs at around a week after it is made and taste it to detect certain good and bad flavors that they think will allow it to be aged and not develop bitter, acidic or off flavors, otherwise it has to get used as a mild cheese.

You are setting out on a course to be an international level scholar with a unique expertise.

I was amazed at the people in my area who had never read seminal papers that their work was based on. If you are one of the people who do like to read, you don't need anyone's help. Start with the textbooks and just go read the original papers they cite. You will read hundreds and hundreds of shitty papers to find a dozen gems. You will find that often modern interpretations of classic papers are exactly backwards (Stephan J. Gould wrote an essay on this once). You will find errors in authors, procedures, and interpretations that have been passed from one lazy academic to another. It's amazing how frequently papers get cited from other papers rather than being read- just like lazy undergraduates. You will spend hours in the library since the good stuff isn't available online. You will order stuff from interlibrary loan (and I don't care how good your school's library is). You may find yourself picking up a reading knowledge of a second language (much of the classic physiology literature is in German and French for instance). Third, if you can't get started on this journey yourself then you should reconsider grad school. Harsh, but true. Simply grab a textbook or a classic review paper (use World of Knowledge or whatever ISI calls it these days to grab a high impact review from 10-20 years ago) and start reading it and the stuff it cites.

As they work out a system for drying fish or trapping other food, they may stay. That's how we think successive generations of (different) people got into what is now Inuit territory.  Temperate zones get crowded. Human strife and conflict is much more likely and many people prefer their wide open spaces.  Let me ask you, Why do you think being in an overpopulated place with high levels of human-caused stress in a temperate zone, is preferable to, say, living in northern Alaska?   People came down onto the US Plains states several times, stayed a few generations, or even less, then left again (or all died). People came to Wales 28,000BP and stayed only briefly, not to return (too damp? what?)  It is true that certain areas were populated last.

Deserts (which may sound inhospitable to you) were inhabited long before temperate or tropical rainforests were. Coastal areas everywhere, whether hot or cold, are populated before continental interiors. Australia was pretty inhospitable to early travelers, and yet we know they came - apparently with deliberation and a plan.   Small tropical islands can be very inhospitable, but people left some other island and risked a lot to go to a new one. One could say that perhaps it's the same reason some of us move away from home, or out of our parents' houses. We want to. We want something different and new.

The idea with orange vs mint is that there's still mint in your mouth, so you're simply tasting both at the same time, right? The same is true for your Italian sub. Oil based compounds stay in your mouth for longer than water based compounds, and oils carry a lot of flavor in food. So your mouth is likely still coated with some of those meat juices when you eat the bread.   It's also not impossible that some of those oils / flavors soaked into the bread in your last bite, so if you would make an Italian sub, then remove all the toppings except mayo and mustard, it would have more flavor than a plain mayo and mustard sandwich.  And that all sticks to the pure mechanics of taste buds/your mouth - perception (what happens when those signals hit your brain) is an additional layer. I can't speak to the specifics of taste (motor system is more my specialty) but as a general rule all of our sensory perceptions affect each other, both within and across modalities. I.e. stimuli you experience from any of your physical senses can impact how you perceive stimuli from any other physical senses, whether it happens at exactly the same time or if there's a little delay between them.

Marriage is about many things -- managing/controlling labor, managing property, procreation, sexuality, companionship, love, authority, alliance, etc. Whether marriage itself is considered \"sacred\" really depends on cultural/historical context, as well as how you define both \"marriage\" and \"sacred\" -- definitions that are by no means universally agreed upon.  A few things will help you clarify your question:  - Neither sex nor romantic love are exclusive to heterosexual pairings. Nor is marriage (although marriage has been reserved for heterosexual pairings in certain contexts at various points in time)  - Most marriage in human history has been more about property, labor and power than love or sex, though these things can be tangled together in messy ways  - Friendship is not always between people of the same gender.  To answer your question with all that in mind, yes. Again, depending on how you define \"sacred\", there are many institutions that might fit this description.  Consider institutions of \"blood brothers\" in many cultures including many European ones.

I spend 7 months in Japan for an internship, and during my time there, one of the things I did was to nerd out on the subject of japanese knifes.   First of all, japanese chefs often prefer carbon steel knives because of its superior edge holding ability and ease of sharpening compared to stainless steel. One side effect of this is that the knives rust. Leaving a knife to rust will cause discoloration. The patina is not a big issue - for many western chefs, a dark patina is considered a proof of their hard work. While the patina is not an issue, leaving a knife wet also causes the edge to rust - meaning your knife will become dull if not properly cared for.   The best and only way to prevent your knife from rusting is to wipe it when it's not in use. Even if you're just gonna leave your knife for 10-15 minutes, wipe it dry. Not \"kinda dry\", really dry. Keep a towel only for keeping your knife dry.   When I say dry, one salesman in tokyo told me to dry the knife with a hairdryer at the end of each day. While this is not necessary, it says alot of how important it is to keep your knife dry.   Also, to keep your knife clean, don't use tough sponges that might wear on the edge, use soft ones or towels together with some plain soap.   Another thing that helps you keep your knife sharp is a good sharpening steel. A common misconception is that a sharpening steel actually makes your edge sharper. It doesn't. It just re-aligns the edge after it's been slightly bent after a days work, so the edge can \"attack\" the food from the right angle.   To keep your knife deadly sharp, invest in a sharpening stone. There are different \"grains\" on sharpening stone, and generally, the lower the number is the rougher the grain is. For everyday sharpening, I recommend a 1000-grain stone and a 6000-grain stone to finish the edge. while a 1000-grain stone is enough for most people, the 6000-grain gives your edge that last bit of polish that is needed for working with sushi.   While I hate the Global-brand more than anything, it's ridiculously overpriced, and not that good to start off with, they do have a great video where a japanese chef shows you how to sharpen your knife with a stone. It's truly a great tutorial, it takes alot of practice but when you get it right, you can make your knife sharper than any professional knife shop with just a couple of minutes work.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIw5ChGOADE  If you want get yourself a real, expensive yanagiba, I reccomend you get a knife from the tokyo-branch of Aritsugu. The aritsugu family has been in the sword&knife-making business since the fifteen hundreds, and this shop is where most people go from the Tokyo Tsukuji Fish Market to get knives and I've had several japanese sushi chefs recommend me this brand. The prices of their knifes aren't too bad, I got myself an incredible Aritsugu A-style 24 cm Wa-gyuoto (chefs knife) for about 150 dollars. Check it out at:  http://aritsugu.jp/   A site I learned alot from is Z-knives. That guy goes ridicously in depth in this knife reviews and even tests and compares steels used in different knives. It's a great read.   http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/indexall.shtml  If you have any more questions about caring for your knifes or buying new knives, I'll be happy to answer any questions."}, {"prefer": "In addition to the concepts of more-evolved or less-evolved culture being subjective, I would argue it is also not a binary or discreet variable at all.

Not only are there 1,000,000 different possibilities, but hybrids and things in between.

So, \"the mind\" as such emerges only from this process by which we alienate ourselves from a more ontologically basic (from the point of view of phenomenology) thing - something like an embodied mind.  Really, there is no mind as such, there is only this embodied mind.  The Cartesian mind is an important practical and theoretical concept, but it is not really the thing we have.  By way of a maybe lame analogy that maybe only works for me - there is a line in Aristotle wherein he describes the body of a dead person as \"a body in name only.\"  That is, it's not *really* a body - a body is the up and moving around thing that we have.  This pure mind that Descartes asks us to imagine through skeptical analysis ends up being something like this - a mind in name only.

Here's a Christian apologist's response to the Euthyphro dilemma. That response is characteristic of nearly every major Christian response to the dilemma since antiquity. Even Augustine responded to the dilemma in the same spirit. The dilemma just is not regarded as a serious stumbling block for divine-command theorists so long as they avoid endorsing certain conceptions of the divine.   On a different note, it's not even obvious to me that Plato advanced the dilemma as an attack on a conception of ethics. In the *Euthyphro*, Socrates was just pushing Euthyphro to give an account of piety, and Euthyphro ends up saying that piety is what the gods love. Now, either the gods love it because it's pious or it's pious because the gods love it. But nowadays we consider the option \"the gods love it because it's pious\" to imply something like \"there must be something higher than the gods, and external to them, and this thing diminishes their greatness!\" And then we take this apparent logical consequence to be a *reductio ad absurdum* of the view that \"the gods love it because it's pious.\" But that is not at all what Plato means. All Plato means is that if the gods love it because it's pious, then we want to know what piety is, and Euthyphro hasn't given us the definition. In other words, by taking that option, Euthyphro wouldn't be undermining divinity, or anything like that; he just wouldn't be answering the question. Socrates wants Euthyphro to give an account of piety. Euthyphro would have to give us the definition used by the gods! The readings of the *Euthyphro* that followed Plato's death didn't really square with Plato's system anyways, since Plato 1) believed that some god existed and 2) believed that piety exists external to this god.  Of course, modern readers can read the *Euthyphro* however they choose.

I would guess they are deflecting from your questions by attacking you about ‘hating poor people.’   I do agree there are concerns around self diagnosis.

I think that there are a number of concerns with self-diagnosis. Some of which are as simple as most people self diagnose, and then use it as an excuse ‘well, I can’t do ‘x’ because I’m depressed.’ When you work with someone, get a diagnosis, you also get tools to support you. If you are self diagnosing, is is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

There are criteria, and while you can learn the criteria in a year or two, it also comes with clinical support and a team to help young professionals as they learn the nuances of diagnoses. I think the availability of info online is often mistaken for the wisdom to interpret and apply that info.

Hair reduces the cooling ability of an animal and our bipedalism is a specialized adaptation to a hot climate. On top of that looking at the biological adaptations we have that deal with bipedalism would have made us worse aquatic animals (we are tall and thin, aquatic animals are short and stout, it deals with heat dissipation and surface area).   On top of that most semi aquatic mammals have a lot of fur. In fact they tend to have the densest, and finest fur of all mammals. The only real exception is Hippos and that deals in their body shape and hydrodynamics (Hippos bones are super dense, and make them sink making fur and air bubbles less likely to help them at any depth, so they compensate with blubber instead of heavy fur though they do still have some fur).   On top of that if you look at semi aquatic mammals they don't have long limbs, that's worse for swimming, and is a horrible adaptation to submersion since it cools the blood in said limbs.   Basically our adaptations are not good for water, but they are great for standing upright in a sunny area.    Point 2: diving reflex, human infants hold their breath automatically when submerged and our heart rate decreased autonomously when our face is wet.  So all mammals that have a womb are born with diving instinct (ironically platypus are the only one that aren't and they are aquatic). Basically its the same feeling as being in the womb so they don't try and breath. It actually disappears quite quickly in humans too. From there any swimming movements should be more seen as an attempt to find traction for movement, not actual swimming.  Point 3: our hooded noses (which prevent water from going into our lungs when upright under water).  So primates can be split into two groups catarrhine (old world monkeys); and Platyrrhini (New world monkeys). All old world monkeys have noses that face down and hooded nostrils. The question of how far down they face is dependent on how defined their nose is from their snout. In humans that deals primarily with the reduction of the honing canine, but all great apes have hooded nostrils.  Point 4: minor webbing of our fingers  We have no more or less \"webbing\" than any of the other great apes.  Point 5: Prune finger reflex (which increases grip underwater)  Well a few things. First off all primates fingers prune up when exposed to water long term. Second it doesn't REALLY increase grip underwater. Every study done doesn't show any real advantage by comparison of pruney fingers to non pruney fingers in dexterity, feeling, or grip. Truth is we aren't exactly sure why they prune up, that's just an explanation that got proposed in 2011 and has kinda stuck in pop science explanations.  AAH is fun to think about, and humans absolutely swam and used aquatic resources earlier than we think about. But it was most likely not a driving force behind our evolutionary traits."}, {"prefer": "Nordic countries are very secular and fall among the lowest in power distance https://doi.org/10.1007/s11575-014-0223-6 Japan is very collectivistic even though Shinto doesn't have a lot of the traits of a religion you might be thinking of like communal worship or a god-given doctrine"}, {"prefer": "A power grid is often referred to as an \"infinite bus.\" You have numerous generation sources and numerous loads using the energy. The contribution of any particular generator has little effect on the grid as a whole. However, the grid cannot store energy. (There are large-scale battery storage projects coming on line, but those still function as either a generation source or as a load when the batteries are charging.) The total amount of energy input to the grid must equal the energy being used. Therefore, you have several classes of generation, including base load (usually big coal or nuclear plants), load followers (large or small plants that are ramped up or down to match the demand), and peakers (usually smaller stations that can be put on line in a hurry to match peak demand.) Hydropower is especially useful in maintaining balance as it can be ramped up and down dramatically in a short time.  A system must have enough \"spinning reserve\" to match any short-term spikes in load. If the demand exceeds generation and no more generation can be ramped up or brought on line, the frequency on the grid is affected and the system can become unstable in some situations. Worst-case scenario is generation starts tripping off-line and parts of the grid become \"islanded.\" Sections can be shed off to preserve the health of the grid as a whole.  Most modern grids have a balancing authority, such as an Independent System Operator (ISO), which procures and schedules generation during the day in anticipation of the estimated load during different times of day."}, {"prefer": "Wittgenstein: Words don't refer to objects, speakers refer to objects using words (or other behaviors)."}, {"prefer": "I have a lot of experience converting regular recipes to vegan recipes.

First, even simple ABMs generate data that \"looks\" a lot like the real world, even if it's not exactly predictive. For example, agent based stock markets will generate fat-tailed return distributions and PE ratios that are close to what we would expect from the real world. This is important because these models do this without being told to do this.   Second, agent based models do not reach equilibrium, no matter the time-frame. DSGE models deviate from equilibrium, but only because of *exogenous* shocks that we impose upon them. ABMs generate their own volatility indefinitely and *endogenously*.   Finally, again, endogenously and without being told to do so, ABMs will exhibit behaviors that closely mimic real world phenomena that can't be predicted using theorum-based models. Agents will show herding behavior. Prices will start to bubble inexplicably then inevitably crash. Much of what allows ABMs to more closely mimic the real world comes from the fact that the decision-makers in ABMs interact with each other within the market rather than through aggregate price-levels.   All that being said, there is still a lot of work to be done before ABMs can be considered more useful than models like the DSGE. My guess is that the main contributions of ABMs for the foreseeable future will be more along the lines of expanding and improving how we conceptualize the economy, but not so much in how we predict economic outcomes."}, {"prefer": "Three thoughts....  1 - If you turned your studies around and did decent towards the end, you're probably not as unhireable as you believe you are.  2 - \"Failed\" engineers often make *great* technicians, so that's a definite career route.

The more electronegative the atom bonded to the proton is, the more easily that bond will break heterolytically (both electrons go with one partner, aka the leaving group).  It makes sense because it is easy to imagine something that is much more electronegative than hydrogen taking both of the electrons in the bond which allows hydrogen to dissassociate.  Fluorine, chlorine, oxygen check this box.  Stabilization of the anion - The conjugate base of an acid usually has a negative charge, and that negative charge represents an instability for that molecule.  The more the negative charge can be spread throughout the molecule via a system of conjugation, the more stable it will be and, conversely, the more tightly focused that negative charge is on, say, a single atom for example, the less stable it is.  For example, bisulfate is able to spread its negative charge between three different oxygen atoms, contributing to its stability.  Conversely, fluoride is a tiny atom with its negative charge tightly focused, which is a significant contributing factor in fluoride not fully dissociating as you would expect based on electronegativity alone.  There are also many extreme examples of anion stability in large conjugated systems in organic acids, especially in cases where the freeing up of the electron pair enables a much larger conjugated system by joining two smaller ones  (or, better yet, an aromatic system!).  The stability of conjugate bases is a part of a larger topic in chemistry about the stability of leaving groups, the same principle applies.  People frequently use pKa as a good measure of the stability of a conjugate base or leaving group.  Solvent stabilizing effects - When we are talking about acids, we are always talking about water as the solvent, but the chemical structure of the acid and the solutes in the water can vary, which can significantly impact the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of the solvent on the proton and anion of a dissociated acid.  For example, organic acids usually get a boost in their dissociation in water because of their inherent instability in water - dissociating in to a pair of ions frequently increases their stability in water.  Also, solutes in water can increase or decrease the ability for water to stabilize ions created in the dissociation of acids.  Edit:  The answer to your sulfuric acid, chloride question requires an additional consideration.  Oxygen is more electronegative than chloride, sure, but due to the valency of oxygen, it is always bonded with something other than the proton and since oxygen is more electronegative than everything other than fluorine, whatever else oxygen is bonded to is always donating (relatively speaking) electric charge to the oxygen, making oxygen less able to pull electrons away from the proton.  Having said that, though, sulfuric acid is still one of the stronger oxyacids due to its ability to spread out that negative charge.  So based on this you would expect oxyacids which are bonded to carbon rather than sulfur to be less acidid because carbon is less electronegative than sulfur.

The Spanish sources from the 1520s do not contain such references and only later Spanish sources pick it up. Although certain aspects of the Spanish arrival could loosely map on to Aztec myths of a god returning, I believe it stretches the imagination that such a belief could be held for any length of time, and the Spanish were in near constant contact with native peoples for months before the main military phase of the conquest began.  Second, where did the Aztecs think they came from. Well, the Spanish told them, Castile. We know the earliest name given to the Spanish was Castilteca, meaning 'people from Castile'. This also tends to suggest that the Aztecs saw the Spanish as people not gods because they rendered them using the same forms as they would any other new people group they encountered.

Depending on how much you want to make (I used to make the shit 25 onions at a time) just french an onion get your saute pan out over high heat. I never used butter just some good high heat oil, you don't need a ton of oil just enough to get a good coat with maybe a little extra. Let it get quite literally smoking hot. Once you are at this point toss those onions in and let it cook for a second before you start moving it. The main ideas here are a few things, first don't overload your pan if you put to much what you basically do is steam your onions with the moisture that is released. Second let the damn things cook you don't have to be constantly moving them, you want some color to develop and those natural sugars to start to release in the liquid (hence caramelization). After about 10-15 minutes (less for smaller batches) of stirring and you should have some really good color starting and your onions should be cooked. Here's where it gets tempting to dump it out but DON'T you see all that nice dark color on the bottom of the pan that's the sweet sugary goodness you want. Turn off the head and cover with a tight lid for about 5-10 minutes, the moisture still being released will condense on your lid, and drip down deglazing all that sugar, give it a good stir to get all that fond off and BOOM heaven made from onions, easy as pie.  Main point is let them onion cook, if you are constantly stirring all you are doing is just letting your pan cool and no real color develop. If you do overload the pan, there's a fix for that but it is a bit more difficult and basically involves a controlled burning, in that you let the onions on the bottom cook through and start to darken then stir. Then let that layer darken, then stir, repeat till color is achieved that like before, a good tight fitting lid and take it off heat  edit: the reason I don't use butter is typical store bought butter had \"solids\" and filler in it that are going to burn and it has a relatively low heat tolerance"}, {"prefer": "While they do resonate well with Buddhism/Taoism and the like, it's important to recognise that stoicism doesn't exactly square the circle.   If we were to sum stoicism up crudely, we might consider it an attempt to alleviate suffering through cognitive evaluation of what we experience. Epictetus, for example, asks us to consider our experiences and classify them as things we either can or cannot control. We should worry about what we can do something about, but it makes no sense to concern ourselves with what we can't control. Some of his examples are pretty out there, let's take being on a ship stricken by a violent storm. Epictetus chastises his students for \"talking the talk\" but not putting what they have learned into practice. They might wail and cry at the storm and the threat of a terrible death by drowning. However, in order to truly be philosophers, they ought to be able to suppress their fear of death by recognising the whole situation as being beyond their control and nothing worth worrying about. It is the same with the sickness of a child, being sentenced to death, suffering grievous bodily harm, etc.  In Buddhist practice the approach is somewhat different. Classification of experiences can play a role, but attaining non-attachment through the intellect is no Buddhist objective. Buddhist practice encourages us to let our thoughts and feelings pass and subside *without* judgement (which is a kind of attachment). Trying to suppress our thinking/feeling with thinking is like trying to pull our way out of a Chinese finger trap. The difference is that stoics assume that feelings result from judgements and that by getting the judgements right, you'll get the feelings right too. Buddhist practice, on the other hand, reveals that feelings emerge in the absence of judgements and are not reliant on them. Feelings are even the soil out of which thoughts grow. Buddhism also lays greater emphasis on the body. To assume and sustain the right posture *is* to assume and sustain the right attitude. For Epictetus, however, our body is an external and something out of our control - the only thing which is truly \"ours\" is our power to evaluate things.  Epictetus, as is well known, lived a life of privation and was a slave for many years. A man with little or nothing to his name. I wonder, though, when Epictetus retired into obscurity and adopted a child if he found it as easy to \"walk the walk\" as he did when he was a bachelor running a philosophy school? How might he have felt with a crying, sick child? We can't know for sure of course..."}, {"prefer": "I'll assume living memory to be a nice round number like 60, so we are looking for the closest Native American nation that did not have direct contact with Europeans between 1657 and 1717. I'll also assume that not all members of the group interacted with Europeans, just that somewhat regular contact/influence existed some time between 1657 and 1717.  The closest nations to Boston, the Wampanoag, Nipmuck, Narragansett and Nashaway, were swept up in the hostilities with King Phillip's War from 1675-1678. Any Native American belligerents not killed in the conflict and not professing Christians were sold into slavery in Bermuda. Praying Indians settled in towns like Natick, Grafton and Marlborough, and refugees fled inland to join other nations.  Expanding out of the direct Boston/Providence Plantation area, we have the nations in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. Coastal populations in Maine would have regular trading contact with white merchants and fisherman, so those nations are out. Further inland many nations possibly contacted a European during King William's War (look, a map] during the 1680s and 1690s. I am not as familiar with the small nations of northern Maine, but I assume the constant tension between the French and English colonial enterprises, and the Maine Amerindians strategic importance as allies, meant they were courted extensively during the period. Further north into Canada the Wendat/Huron were strongly allied with the French, and during the diaspora caused by the Beaver Wars (to be explained shortly) fled west to the Great Lakes.  Looking west, here is a generalized map so we can keep our bearings. The Mahican and the Delaware definitely encountered Europeans in the period of interest. First contact along the Mohawk River occurred in 1609 and these groups were intimately involved in the game of colonial expansion with New York/New England/New France.   1657-1717 is a very interesting time for the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois. Hostilities related to the fur trade and disease mortality brought about a series of mourning wars that increased the Haudenosaunee territory, and wrought destruction over a huge swath of the U.S. Midwest. The Beaver Wars turned the Great Lakes into a war zone. Iroquois raids depopulated much of the U.S. Midwest and sent refugees fleeing to the lands bordering the Great Plains. French missionaries fled west with their Huron flock, establishing missions on Lake Michigan by 1652 and the western tip of Lake Superior by 1661. As they moved west, the Huron diaspora opened up the fur trade to nations previously beyond the frontier outposts. Heading directly west of Boston we are basically on the Great Plains before we consider a nation without European contact.  Next, lets dive south. English colonial enterprises in Pennsylvania contacted the Erie, Shawnee and previously mentioned Iroquois. Jamestown was established in 1607, and English influence continued to grow among the Algonquian nations living in the tidewater. To the west of the tidewater we start to run into the area of Iroquois expansion during the Beaver Wars so I will dive further south.  Between 1657 and 1717,  traders operating out of Virginia and Carolina colonies united the greater U.S. Southeast based on the trade of Indian slaves and deerskins. Though actual \"white guy presence\" was limited, the repercussions of the Indian slave trade destabilized the south. Pressure from the French and English spurred the rise of confederacies like the Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw to deal with the encroachment of the French to the west (operating from Louisiana and the Mississippi River) and the English (with their native, slave-raiding allies) to the east. As an aside, from 1696-1700 a devastating smallpox epidemic spread through the southeast causing tremendous mortality in the region. Epidemics, combined with refugees fleeing the Yamasee War from 1715-1717, shattered the existing lifeways in the south. The interior southeastern nations, as well as the petite nations along the Gulf Coast, all felt the repercussions of contact with Europeans between 1657 and 1717.  So, we are at the Mississippi and we have yet to encounter a Native American nation without contact with/significant influence from Europeans between 1657 and 1717. Obviously, the nations of New Mexico and Texas near Spanish missions are out of consideration. In New Mexico the Spanish presence along the Rio Grande ensures the Pueblos, Apaches, Utes, Dine, Comanche and many smaller Southwestern nations could contact a white guy. The first mission in Spanish Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas, was established in 1690. The Spanish presence in Texas was not influential, long-lived, or particularly productive during our time period, but it does mean we need to look north of the Red River for a nation that fits our criteria (Edit: The first mission founded in the geographic region that we know as Texas was San Angelo, founded in 1632. Thanks to /u/_choupette for clarifying.)  Where does this leave us? In 1717 you would need to be on the Great Plains, likely north of the Red River, and west of French influence along the Mississippi River/Great Lakes to encounter a Native American nation that had yet to contact a white person. Even then, contact was imminent. For example, the first European encounter with the Mandan occurred with the arrival of a French Canadian trader, Sieur de la Verendrye, in 1738.  **Sources**  Calloway *Once Vast Winter Count: The Native American West Before Lewis and Clark*  Kelton *Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast 1492-1715*  Gallay *The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717*  Bragdon *Native Peoples of Southern New England, 1650-1775*  Trigger *The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660*  Weber *The Spanish Frontier in North America*"}, {"prefer": "The short story is that compatibilism denies this:  > If we live in a deterministic universe, free will is impossible.  So, the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is about the necessary conditions for Free Will.   Some people think this is a cheap semantic move or something evasive, but it isn't - it's a conceptual argument about how the burden of Free Will should be understood.  Imagine someone came up to you and said, \"Hey - did you know that you can *never* make a good decision because you can *never* know what will happen with absolute certainty?\"  Most people would say, \"Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a \"good decision.\"   That's a useless and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.\"  This isn't a trivial game of word golf here - this is a substantive dispute about how we should think about what it means to make a \"good decision.\"  Importantly, there isn't some rock somewhere that we turn over which has this definition printed on it.  \"Free Will\" is the same way.  We might first ask what the concept is supposed to do.  One thing it is often thought to do is be a necessary condition for moral responsibility.  That is, I can't be blamed for what I do if I had no control over what I'm doing.  Once we can agree on that much (that Free Will is the thing you'd need to be morally responsible), then it should become clear that it's not obvious that libertarian free will (the kind of free will which determinism would deny - the weird freedom from causality) is necessary for moral responsibility.  As a result, there have been lots of theories of moral responsibility which accept determinism going back, at least, to the ancient stoics (who developed a pretty famous ethical system and were causal determinists).  In sum - it's hard to know what you do or don't \"get,\" but it may just be that you have found yourself in that spot that a lot of first-time readers of compatibilism have found themselves in - thinking that the compatibilist is trying to pull a fast one or something.  That's not what's happening.  If anything, it's the Hard Determinists who are doing this, by trying to claim the necessary conditions for Free Will were decided already in a way which can't be contested.  This is nonsense.  Abstract and material terms are subject to contest and revision.  If they weren't, then the Hard Determinists couldn't avail themselves of a modern definition of causality.  ETA - My above analogy seems to have been helpful, but also a bit misleading.  So, to clarify a part of my analogy:  > Most people would say, \"Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a \"good decision.\" That's a *useless* and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.\"  Some folks have seized on one clause in this hypothetical, but, really, I didn't mean it to be terribly important.  Really the argument here is about a *good* definition for Free Will.  (To be fair, I do also think that important concepts need some kind of utility.)  The argument between my two imagined persons is about the *better* way to think about a particular concept.  I avoid saying \"right\" or \"accurate\" here to avoid some other conceptual problems, though I think it's all the same thing.  Anyway, imagine an alternate situation instead from the point of view of the libertarian.  Say that the libertarian meets a person who declares, \"We have no free will!\"  The Libertarian says, \"Oh, yes!  I agree!  But, just in case, why do you think this?\"  The interlocutor says, \"Oh, well, having free will requires that I can do what I want.  I want to fly.  I cannot fly.  Therefore, I cannot do what I want to do.  Therefore, I don't have free will.\"  Whatever we can say about Libertarians, they don't believe *this*.  Clearly the Libertarian disagrees with this interlocutor.  Wherein lies the disagreement?  Probably the Libertarian will say this, \"No - I think you're a bit confused about what it might mean to 'do what you want' or else you're just confused about what having Free Will entails.\"  (Also, by the way, might not the Libertarian point out that this is a very silly way to think about Free Will given that everyone knows before the conversation starts that humans can't will themselves into flight?  This interlocutor has defined and ended the argument before it started.)  Anyway, here, the Libertarian would not be engaging in some semantic mumbo jumbo by trying to show this person that they've conceived of things wrongly.  If the Libertarian's response to this interlocutor is mumbo jumbo, then what does their own position even amount to?  Neither party of this dispute can turn over a rock to see who wins - they'll need to give some arguments for thinking that Free Will requires [x] or [y] - regardless of whether or not is *exists*.  As others have pointed out below, people have some kind of conception of Free Will and what matters about it, but this doesn't mean that all of those conceptions make sense or are equally good or, if you're willing, are *true*.  When we ask people what they think about Free Will, we learn *something*, but we don't obviously learn something about Free Will *itself*.  In the same way, we could ask people on the street what Time is and not learning anything about Time *itself*.  Here too, there is no easy rock to look under to find out what Time *is* (or else the A vs B debate would be long dead).  Or, if you don't buy this analogy, consider that folk definitions of Free Will almost always rely on a notion of Causation, and yet folk notions of Causation are often totally at odds with even what scientists think causation is like (much less philosophers).  Anyway, all I meant to do above is show one way to see how the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is something other than word golf or semantics.  And, to be really clear, philosophers who are divided about this are not confused here - folks in all the camps about Free Will give rather sustained arguments for their positions and understand this to be totally necessary to making their position justifiable - even the libertarians and hard determinists.  As a final amendment, some folks have suggested that what Compatibilists are doing is making a \"new\" definition for Free Will.  This also isn't true, since Compatibilist arguments go back *at least* to the Ancient Greek Stoics.  If that counts as \"new,\" well, then *everything* about modern hard determinism, unless, of course, Hard Determinists are using a theory of physical causation, the soul, and human motivation derived from Aristotle.

So my short answer will be heavily dependent on the few things I have read.   They are probably more similar than they are different, at least in method. But I think the main difference would be largely decided by the nature of the question you are asking. Of course there is much overlap, but my guess is that the difference between the kinds of questions Anths and Socs will be interested in is deeply influenced by the history of those disciplines. If your ethnography is about kinship, identity, etc - it will tend towards the Anth, while if you are asking how people make sense of institutions or social classes, that's more sociological. Annette Lareau and Michael Burawoy are two of the most prominent examples of Sociological Ethnographers. But again, my guess is that they have in a sense grown MORE similar, at least over the last 30-40 years, as anthropologists have become more interested in systems and macro issues (and not just the 'natives on the island'). Likewise, sociological ethnogs would probably be more willing to pay attention to local interactions after the Cultural turn in the 1970s and the distancing from positivist epistemology.   But this historical trajectory is a little misleading I think because many of the very earliest sociologists were indeed highly qualitative (and women) and it was only after an obsession with quant data from census etc that qualitative methods fell out of style in Sociology for a while.   The Extended Case Method (from Max Gluckman and the Machester school) is an interesting development in itself. It began in anthropology but then fell out of style as the Geertzian interpretivist tradition because the sin qua non of american anthro. But then Burawoy and a few other sociologists picked it up in an attempt to write ethnographies that dealt with local interactions but also took seriously the macro contexts that shaped the local situations.   I think the type of question and the assumption about who the 'members' (i.e. the ethnos) are will see an ethnography tend in one or the other direction. If the members are connected by institutional, class, race or other (larger) relationships - and the ethnographer is trying to say something about SOCIETY - then it's more sociological. If the relationships are village/location, family, etc it may be more anthro.   As I am thinking through this, I can probably come up with lots of points that refute what I have said.

The exaust velocity of a turbofan is around 300 m/s and that of a good rocket is around 3,000 m/s.  In space the mass efficiency, how much propellant you have to expel to change your spaceship's velocity by a given amount, is entirely a factor of the exhaust velocity.  The reason that a jet engine is so efficient on the ground is that very little of the propellant that comes out of the engine is fuel that has to be carried by the airplane.  Mostly it's atmospheric nitrogen with the water and CO2 combustion products of the fuel combustion mixed in.  Since the fuel that has to be carried is such a small fraction of the exhaust stream a jet operating in the atmosphere is as efficient as if it was expelling the fuel at 30,000 m/s.  Having an unlimited amount of gas you can stuff into your engine is useful!  There are engines called turborockets that use the energy from the rocket to drive a turbofan that adds atmospheric gases to the exhaust to increase the rocket efficiency.  Not as much as with a jet engine since the rocket brings its own oxidizer but quite a bit.  And you still get most of the great thrust to weight ratio a rocket gives you.

Algebra laid down a few foundational concepts in logic, and geometry cemented a lot of those concepts with formal proofs and analogies to how \"real world\" logic works. Then in the post- geometry math courses, we used algebraic proofs to establish how different relationships arise between numbers and formulas. The point of this coursework was to establish the foundations for higher level math, but for those of us who didn't go much further in math, it laid down a lot of foundational skills in logic and reasoning (and by extension, common fallacies and mistakes in reasoning).  Contemporaneously with that math education, our science education started relying more on math (and the attendant logical problem solving skills). How do we tie together the known formulas and definitions to figure out the unknowns starts teaching the use of logic as a \"toolbox\" for solving problems. I also took a programming class in high school, which relied heavily on an assumption that we had strong logic skills.  Then, the rhetoric and persuasion type courses start building up practice in practical use of logic in non-technical disciplines. Literature coursework starts exploring a lot of philosophical concepts, especially ethics, truth, fairness, etc. Reading works from different religious traditions really started to demonstrate the importance of certain philosophical underpinnings in different cultures. We get to thinking about these things before even taking a formal philosophy course.   By the time I took a formal philosophy course, I realized that it was just a condensed, focused version of things I had already learned in high school. I ended up majoring in philosophy, but I think that my high school education was already pretty strong in philosophy, at least as much as one could expect for students of high school age and experience. In fact, one of the most notoriously difficult sophomore courses in my major, symbolic logic, was made easier from my high school math experience.

Mass incarceration is terrible and should be used absolutely as sparingly as possible.   It's extremely expensive. It costs way more to house a prisoner per year than the average American pays in taxes, and that's not even counting the indirect losses in terms of lost workers from the labor force.  Frivolous incarceration often increases crime. You take an edgy teen and throw them in prison for 10 years and give them a criminal record. You have both destroyed their employability and also ensured that their closest acquaintances are now all hardened felons, making them much more likely to turn to crime upon release.  And perhaps most importantly, harsh sentences do little if anything to deter crime. Criminals respond much more strongly to *likelihood* of being apprehended, which you can increase through more robust policing, but they are surprisingly unconcerned with the size of the penalty. Except it's actually not all that surprising on closer inspection because anyone who thought there was a realistic likelihood of being caught wouldn't commit the crime to begin with. Humans are terrible at precisely calculating the exact size of tail-end risks with severe ramifications, like 1% chance of a stiff sentence.

In many cases, much of the tension arose between Jewish and Gentile Christians. But not necessarily. One of the narratives in the New Testament itself that addresses dietary issues (and some of the Christian innovations regarding them) is found in the 10th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:  >Peter went up on the roof to pray. 10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat; and while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 11 He saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground by its four corners. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air. 13 Then he heard a voice saying, \"Get up, Peter; kill and eat.\" 14 But Peter said, \"By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean.\" 15 The voice said to him again, a second time, \"What God has made clean, you must not call profane.\"   This is almost certainly more representative of the so-called \"supersessionist\" branch, which prioritized the coming/sacrifice of Christ and its transformative effects over observance of Jewish law.  We can see another narrative that addresses kosher/dietary things, just a few chapters later (in Acts 15). Described here is a \"council\" in Jerusalem, with many the most important Christian figures present: James, Peter, Paul. In the end, these figures produce a letter which is then sent to Gentiles churches, advising that Gentiles should \"abstain . . . from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood.\" This list is virtually identical to that in Leviticus 17-18: prohibiting meat offered to idols (17.8-9), ingestion of blood (17.10-12) and improperly slaughtered animals (17.15).  I've written about this in more detail here - but just to pick out one little section:  >there's no real indication from [the council related in Acts 15] that Paul and the Jerusalem church get along anything other than splendidly (\"our dear friend\" Paul, etc.) . . . Yet the letter that they then send back with Paul (to Antioch, Syria, Cilicia) seems to have \"agreements\" which, elsewhere, are quite opposed by Paul. While - for the sake of space - skipping over some nuances here, consider Paul's blanket statement in 1 Cor 10:25-26:  >>Eat *anything* that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience’s sake; \"for the earth is the Lord's, and all it contains\"  ____  Ultimately, as the Christian church became a majority *Gentile* church, the supersessionist 'faction' won out - evidence of which is certainly found in the accounts of Acts themselves (which, as a whole, is a highly fictionalized [quasi-]'history').   It's absolutely fascinating to look at early Islam's relationship with all this. There's some evidence that some of the influence of some of the more primitive Jewish-oriented Christian sects survived, and may have still been around to have influenced Islam (that could be its own thread). But in any case, it all fits in with Islam's portrait of a Christianity which - though still founded by figures that were truly divinely inspired, and worth of reverence - had gone too far in its rejection of the laws and theology of its 'mother' traditions, introducing heretical innovations."}, {"prefer": "You might enjoy The Flavor Bible."}, {"prefer": "In restaurants, we regularly peel and punch fries several days in advance, drain and replace the water once a day.

The authors who found this fossil argue that it is because:  > \"A combination of primitive and derived features in the Harbin cranium establishes a good set of diagnostic features that were used to define a new Homo species.\" via Shao et al: https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00056-4, published yesterday.   Basically, there are certain features that tend to be specifically diagnostic of species difference when we look at hominids. Things like brain size, face length, brow size, tooth differences, cheek bone size, etc. The reason we look at these things is because they tend to be variable between species, but fairly consistent within species. And, even in cases where one or more of these traits is variable (e.g., a baby born with microcephaly), all the concomitant traits probably won't change much. For example, the authors note that this fossil has a mix of features that are commonly seen in more human-like hominids, and those more common in \"primitive\" hominids:   Like humans: > \"large cranial capacity, short face, and small check bones\"   More \"primitive:\" > \"low vault, strong browridges, large molars, and alveolar prognathism\" via Ni et al: https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00055-2, published yesterday.   Because this combination of traits isn't known in any other hominid, and because it doesn't seem to showcase signs of any known disease or deformity, it's unlikely (although never impossible) that this is just, like, some guy who looked real weird.    Still, the leap that this is a brand new species just from one skull is problematic. First of all, there are known species of hominid that have unknown skull structures. The article you linked to mentions Devisovans as an example of this. They are a close relative species of ours, and some people of east Asian descent have their DNA in their genomes! We only know they exist because we sequenced the DNA of some non-skull bones, so we have no idea what their heads would have looked like. That means it's possible that this is just a skull of a species we already knew about. Even if this is the case, that's still a really cool find!    I should also mention that even if this is a species we already knew about, it's almost certainly not *H. sapiens*, as the time and place it was found doesn't match up with human migration. Present evidence suggests that modern humans probably didn't make it to East Asia until about 50,000 years ago, and this individual lived in present day China over 146,000 years ago."}, {"prefer": "Same reason why chewing minty gum or brushing your teeth makes sweet things taste bad.

Your question is based on a common misconception about the Victorian period, so I’m going to spend some time debunking that misconception and then try to explain why perfectly reasonable people believe it.   The Victorian period did not represent a sudden rupture from the past with regards to sexuality. Same sex desire and homosexuality and sex outside of marriage were taboo to differing degrees in different times and places in Western culture for centuries. The Victorians did not just up and decide that sex was bad outside of nowhere.   However, this is not to say that the Victorians didn’t differ from the generations immediately preceding them in some ways. One important development of the Victorian period was its heavy emphasis on domesticity. For the Victorians, the home and the family were paramount, the basis of the superior British civilization. The home was an oasis protected from the harsh outside world, a place of comfort where you can rest with your loved ones. Note that this ideal of the home and the family is not so different from how we as a culture think of homes and families today. However, for the Victorians, this idea of the home carried with it a hierarchy, with the husband and father as the head of house, the wife and mother as caretaker of the home (the \"Angel in the House,\" as one famous poem called it), both working to bring up well-adjusted, successful children.  Of course, people before the Victorians had homes and families and valued these things highly. The Victorians didn’t invent the family. What shifted was the importance of the family as a social category that needed to be protected and conceptions of public vs private life. On one hand, the nineteenth century saw, for respectable middle class people, the home was a private sphere, secluded from the world and with significantly more privacy within the home than had been available in previous centuries. Privacy has its own earlier history and development that other users can speak to better than me; for our purposes it’s enough to say that the domestic sphere was supposed to be private.   I say this with the caveat that I’m describing middle class people here; the working classes often lived in very different conditions. This cult of domesticity was very much a phenomenon of the middle class, who set themselves up as the upright, respectable contrast to the stereotypical image of the profligate and licentious aristocrat that had been promoted in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century as the rake or the libertine.   However, there is a contradiction in the Victorian family in that domesticity was also often the subject of public performance. We can argue that this phenomenon is reflected best at the top of society with Queen Victoria herself. Victoria navigated the contradiction of being a woman monarch. Women are supposed to be the Angel in the House, master of the private sphere, not involved in public life. To reconcile this, Victoria made a public performance of being the nation's exemplary mother—utterly devoted to her husband and many, many children.

Wisconsin actually addresses the death of a tenant in statute, Wisc. §704.165.  If you and/or his family provide notice to the landlord of his death, your roommate's tenancy can end in 60 days, so his estate's obligations to pay rent end too.   They don't need a certified death certificate;  the law just requires that the landlord *know* the tenant is dead.  But the same statute doesn't give you the ability to end your obligations under the lease:  it specifically says in subsection 3:  >Nothing in this section relieves another adult tenant of the deceased tenant's premises from any obligation under a rental agreement or any other liability to the landlord.  So your options are to negotiate with your landlord, or force their hand.  They may decide to let you out of the lease.   They might agree to do so for the equivalent of one month's rent.  Or they might be hard-asses and offer nothing.  Wisconsin, like most other states, obligates a landlord to \"mitigate their damages\" by re-renting the apartment if you break the lease and move out.   That obligation is written into landlord-tenant law (Wisc. §704.29) instead of being a common-law tradition.

One can certainly read secondary material which gives an intepretation of Hegel's project, but without any engagement with the primary source, you will be left largely unable to do 2 key things: (1) distinguish between better or worse interpretations and (2) thereby, determine when a disagreement you have with 'Hegel' is actually with him, or with an interpreter's idiosyncratic reading of him.   While I believe it is generally worthwhile to engage with Hegel's primary source material, you may have specific reasons for your need to engage with Hegel that, given the difficulty of such study, make this a less valuable way to spend your time. For example, if you are really just interested in the influence of Hegel on French thought in the latter half of the 20th century, (e.g. because you want to just understand *those* projects more thoroughly), then you may not *absolutely* need to read Hegel directly -- (however, I would still of course personally recommend it.) The reason for this is that this influence was, by and large, shaped by the readings of Hegel developed by Kojeve and Hyppolite. Still, it might be argued that any adequate understanding of a philosophical project would include recognition of where that project's plausibility (or validity or whatever) depends on *mis*-understanding or only partially understanding some project to which it takes itself to respond. In that case, it may become worthwhile, yet again, to read the original texts of Hegel.   Now, that's just one example, but hopefully it gives a sense of what I mean. There are many good introductory books on Hegel, but a number of them disagree on basic issues. As such, it might be helpful if you provided a little bit more context.   As such, the first thing I might do is point you to the SEP article on Hegel, which gives both a rough summary of the comparatively uncontested understanding of Hegel's philosophy and a breakdown of some of the larger disagreements in the secondary literature. Likewise, it generally cites the figures to whom the major interpetative stances belong, so you can probably follow it's direction if one or the other sounds most relevant or compelling to you.

Lets say you have a 1W flashlight and aim it at Mars, the intensity very far away from this flashlight will drop off as the distance squared (also a little extra from absorption and scattering in the atmosphere).  Without doing any exact calculations, if we assume scattering is negligible we can say the intensity that hits Mars will be larger than  I > 1W / (2 pi * (225 million km)^2) ~ 3 × 10^-24 W /m^2  Mars has a surface area of 144.8 million km², so the power hitting Mars will be around  I * A/4 ~ 2.3 × 10^-10 W  This isn't a lot of power, but a single photon at optical wavelengths has an energy of around 3 × 10^-19 J, so this is still billions of photons a second hitting Mars.    Edit: Lots of people are pointing out the beam divergence and scattering I ignored. Scattering I still don't think is very significant, about a fraction 10^−5 of the light will be scattered for every meter of travel, most of earths atmosphere is within 20 km of the surface so the intensity is reduced by a factor of around  I/I_0 = exp(-20000*10^-5) ~ 0.8  which is a 20% loss and thus not significant.  If you aimed the beam through more atmosphere or if you had a blue flashlight this gets worse, but never significant.  The beam divergence depends heavily on how wide a flashlight you have to start with, if you had something which is quite compact the divergence is worse than something with a large output.  Most of the power is actually in a spherical segment which is, say, 30 degrees in size, where as my calculation assumed this was closer to 90 degrees.  To compensate the intensity on Mars would be bigger by a factor of  (90/30)^2 = 9 ~ 10."}, {"prefer": "The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down   by Anne Fadiman"}, {"prefer": "In Tennessee the statute of limitations for a personal injury  is one year.

With a 1.5 SF, that fully accounts for any ammo manufacturer giving a slight defect with higher pressure.   The only problems come into play are when same cartridge dimensions are used, people reloading ammo (trying to push the limits or making an error), and cartridges with different max pressures for the same caliber (which is what I heard happened here). The first problem is rare and only happens with say you bought a .223 AR and loaded it with 5.56mm, you aren't going to have a fun time. The 5.56 has higher pressures than the .223 but both are often used interchangeably. As for reloading ammo, it is important for the individual to understand the firearm has limits and they need to ensure not to go past the pressure rating for the cartridge.

First off, just your undergrad is 4 years of your life which you haven't even begun. Assuming you graduate from that (Which a decent chunk do not), a large majority decide they are done with school and go in to the workforce.  Next, a Masters, and then a Ph.D (Which you need for a faculty (\"professor\") position) is another 6-8 years, and it's *very* tough. One could make the argument that you can tough your way through an undergrad - this is not true in grad school. Unless you know you want to do it, you're going to have a very hard time (And even then...). Pay isn't very good, and the hours are long. I never recommend anyone plan on grad school until they know they like what they're doing. Plenty decide to go into the industry after finishing their degree.  Then you have post docs, which is another 2-4+ years. The pay is a little better, but still not great. And then you apply for faculty positions, which are HIGHLY competitive. If you manage to get one, you're then contending with long hours, an insane amount of work/publishing schedule, tenure reviews, and god knows what else. By the time you get tenure, it's been another 10-15 years since your first post-doc, and even longer by the time you make full professor.  And all of this is assuming you clear every hurdle, which is no small feat. You may decide the life isn't for you, that you don't like school enough to do an advanced degree (or perhaps even finish your undergrad), or who knows what else. There's a LOT lying between you and being a professor right now, including a fair amount of luck.  My best recommendation would be to start your undergrad with the idea that you want to **consider** grad school. Focus on doing well in classes, and consider trying to get undergrad research opportunities if they are available.

Firstly, I'm sorry you're feeling terrible about your PhD and the country in general. I know it sucks. I really, really understand. My first year was hell. Luckily my supervisors spoke English well but my colleagues in my lab did not. The administration is a complicated, the people can be cold and standoffish, and the atmosphere can quickly become depressing.  Secondly, my advice about the country: Take a deep breath and get proactive. This country is known for its standoffish people when it comes to language. BUT there are many expats and travellers here. I advise you to seek out other international PhD students in your team/lab/building/university. Look for English Libraries and join in. Check your doctoral school and attend a mixer or two. 100% there are other international students who are struggling too, and there are probably PhDs of the country who can speak English and would be willing to help here and there for translation. Build your support network!  Thirdly, administration. It gets easier after the first year after you are in the system. I know it sucks to get all the cards and forms and applications filled in. But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn't even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it! Do it immediately and keep copies of all the documents in a folder so when you have to apply for residene permits etc. again, you have it already.  Lastly, and probably the most important for you, your PhD and supervisors. I assume you are in your first year? Honestly, if you feel the need to quit do it. There is no shame in it and it takes immense strength to look at the big picture of your life and say \"This isn't working\". But, if you feel you might want to continue, you'll need to consider a few things. HR is not your friend. Seek counselling if you can (there should be free services available to you, speak to the International Researchers office of your university to find resources - ask for counselling options and help with administration). As for your supervisors - only you know how bad it really is. I would not directly approach your supervisors and tell them you're not happy. I don't think they would be receptive to this.  But I strongly advise you to learn the language of the country. STRONGLY. Spend this holiday time putting in the energy and work. It will help you  immeasurably. The fact is, you are in their country and you need to speak the language. If they laugh at your poor grammar, who cares as long as you can communicate! If you choose to stay, take their behaviour towards you as part of the PhD - you need to defend your ideas, vision, and data.

The first is that the idea of violence in the American West is very different in reality than it is as portrayed in popular media. I've written elsewhere about the most popular visual representation of this, the 'duel at high noon', which is almost entirely absent from the historical record despite being the climactic showdown of countless dime novels and films, but looking more broadly too, while that isn't to say the West *wasn't* violent, it certainly wasn't lawless. Historiography since the 1970s or so has mostly pushed back against the idea of the \"Wild, Wild West\", even if the public mind hasn't, and continues to relish the image.   In any case though, body counts get exaggerated in the retelling, and that is assuming the best of intentions. Much of Dodge City's infamous reputation was created from whole cloth by Stuart Lake who did a supposedly \"as-told-to\" autiobiography of Wyatt Earp which quotes liberally from primary sources that never existed to describe dozens of deaths that never happened, while in reality its \"wild days\" were limited to the first year or so of settlement. Similarly Montana Territory was claimed to have over 100 murders by the editor Thomas Dimsdale, but the reality is often much duller. Scholarly assessment of the period substantiates eight in that time frame. Similarly, take a place such as Deadwood, a well known locale for its lack of any actual law enforcement during its initial settlement and most famously represented in the show of the same name... which only experienced 4 murders in that first year of settlement-without-law enforcement - possibly less than a single episode of the show, although it has been ages since I watched it. Returning to Dodge city though, when one year the city experienced a total of 5 murders, this was heralded as a \"civic disaster\", the highest total the city experienced aside from its first year of habitation in 1872 when the entirety of its wild reputation was earned, with slightly over a dozen homicides of all types (murder, self-defense, manslaughter).  Now to be sure, looking at raw numbers tells only half the tale, and it is homicide rates can tell us another side. 5 deaths in a population of 600 is a much bigger deal than a population of 6 million, after all, but as they say, it is pretty easy to lie with statistics. If I told you that the homicide rate in Dodge City was 100.4 per 100,000 (the US was 5.3 per 100,000 in 2016 for comparison) in 1880, that would seem shocking... but if I told you a single person was murdered that year, it would seem considerably less so! The population that year was only 996, and the death of Henry Heck at the hands of John Gill was the sole difference between a murder rate of 0 and 100. This is quite important in understanding how murder was viewed in the period, as the difference in *rates* seems high, but was likely quite unconcerning to the population when it was a difference of only one, two, or maybe three people.  Now to be sure, this doesn't exactly answer your question, but I preface all of this to say that when we are talking about murder in the American West, we're talking about very small numbers. A sheriff in many towns might never even have to draw his gun in his career, and even in a \"violent\" place like Dodge City, the coroner was being called out a few times per year. Lawmen would be much more likely to be hunting down horse thieves and cattle rustlers, which happened at a great deal high rate. Dykstra's \"Quantifying the Wild West\" and \"To Live and Die in Dodge City\" are both useful for a good deal more statistical analysis stuff, which is interesting, but not what we need to dive into here.  Now, let us say that someone has been murdered. The location isn't terribly important, but let's follow the case of Lincoln County, Nebraska as that is what I have sources on, although this is really quite equally applicable to most settled areas, lawmen and legal systems being present and generally followed in any town or city of any noticeable size.   Anyways, for starters, often the sheriff or his deputies needed to do next to nothing when someone was killed, not because of the evidence, but because they would turn themselves in. Claims of justification or self-defense were fairly common, the law about it permissive, and assuming prosecutors even thought to go through with it, juries were not unsympathetic. In the strange perspective of the West, murder wasn't even seen as the worst crime - horse thieves often enjoyed worse sentences - and *how* one dealt with the killing, presenting their actions as honorable and correct, could go a long way. Will Hale, for instance, murdered several people in 1870s Texas, the first a man who hat been cheating at cards, and then following that his brothers when they attempted to exact their revenge. The first killing was likely unjustified by the law, but prosecutors didn't feel it worth going after, and the latter ones were considered self-defense so given a pass as well.  Especially if there were no witnesses, a homicide committed in private could be presented as the killer was able to justify it, but even with several, if the victim 'had it coming' prosecutorial discretion would often let it slide and leave many murders unindicted. Only a total of four murders in Lincoln County during the 1870-1900 period actually proved to require real investigation by law enforcement, lacking witnesses to name a suspect, and these perhaps speak to the core of your question here.  The most interesting case is that of the murder of Kate Manning, killed at her land claim in 1871, a very clear execution by single gunshot. A sheriff and deputy were called and found footprints which they took plaster molds of. Comparison with suspects showed that her own brother, Peter, matched due to a deformity of the foot and he was brought to trial. What is important here is that he was found not guilty. Maintaining his innocence, we can easily presume that the jury didn't find a brother visiting his sister to be compelling enough evidence to go beyond 'reasonable doubt', although my efforts to find the trial documents for State v. Manning failed so we can't say for certain (Records are here just presumably not digitized). In 1871, Loyal Bly was found murdered but a lack of an clues at the scene meant there was nothing to go on. A more successful case, regarding the death of a cowboy, was solved when the murderer turned out to be a fellow cowboy he had worked with and not gotten along with.  To in short there, how would you get away with murder in the \"Wild West\"? Don't have any witnesses, and don't be the person with the most motive. Circumstantial evidence could, at least in the case of Manning, be explained away, and if there was nothing at the scene of the crime at all, it would likely be a dead end for investigation, especially lacking modern forensics. Lacking clues the only real avenue was checking to see \"Who might have wanted them dead?\" and if you weren't that person, you probably could get away with it scott free.   A side note of course can be made here, namely that the courts themselves and the court of public opinion were different beasts. Attempts to lynch suspects before trials were not unheard of, especially if the victim was popular, young, or female. Manning was nearly subjected to one for instance, and it was common to move the venue of a trial, both for the safety of the accused lest a mob conspire to take him, and also to ensure a more impartial jury. So in any case, the point here is that even if you might be \"Not Guilty\" by standards of the court, being caught at all could have its dangers no matter your confidence in acquittal. But the larger picture, really, should be that murders weren't that common, and real \"Who Dunnits\" were quite few and far between.  **Sources**  Dykstra, Robert R. \"Quantifying the Wild West: The Problematic Statistics of Frontier Violence\" *Western Historical Quarterly* 40 (Autumn 2009): 321-347  -- \"To Live and Die in Dodge City: Body Counts, Law and Order, and the Case of Kansas v.

As one might expect, for such a politically charged and relevant question it becomes *really* difficult to separate history proper from politics.   One reasonable way to approach the question is to look at what the leaders of the revolution thought and how they preceived or justified authoritarianism. It's also important to understand their political experience and context.   A good starting point I think is the late 19th century, when the Second International, an association of primarily Marxist parties across Europe, suffered an internal crisis between *reformists* and *revolutionists*. At that point, the revolutionary character of Marxism was not yet agreed upon among its followers, and within the parties reformist Marxists tended to hold sway. Unlike modern social democrats, these reformists still (if only nominally) held the ultimate goal of overcoming capitalism; the major disagreement was if this could be achieved by working entirely within the bourgeois state. This question of reform or revolution is discussed with some more historical context in the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg's eponymous pamphlet, written at the height of this conflict. Eduard Bernstein's works give the reformist perspective.  (As an aside, Rosa Luxemburg was a revolutionist in Germany and Poland who collaborated extensively with Lenin. She would later disagree tactically with Lenin during the Russian revolution but, as I believe, they had no fundamental doctrinal differences-- one can expect that Luxemburg's comments about reform and revolution are broadly the same as Lenin's)  As Europe approached the First World War, the reformist tendency within socialist parties would deepen and even take on a nationalistic character. By then, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) had become the dominant socialist party within Europe, having achieved significant labor reforms and boasting a membership in the millions. This, combined with the threat of invasion from a deeply reactionary Russia, compelled German reformists to associate socialism with German patriotism, and national defense with the defense of socialism (ironically, a similar trend would occur in France *against* Germany, which many Frenchmen perceived as a reactionary threat against their republic). Revolutionists, on the other hand, tended to have an internationalist outlook, believing that only an international revolution against imperialist warfare could defend socialism.  When WW1 broke out at last, the SPD (and most other European parties) voted in favor of war, beginning a period of *Burgfriedenspolitik* wherein the SPD abstained from strikes and other subversive activities against the war effort. The revolutionists and few reformists who disagreed with this policy splintered away from the SPD into the Independent SPD, the Spartacist League, and eventually the German Communist Party. Notably, Lenin's party in Russia also opposed war by majority, foreshadowing the dominance of revolutionists in the upcoming struggle.  This is all to say that the events leading up to WW1 and the Russian revolution precipitated huge, seemingly irreconciliable divisions between the reformist and revolutionist factions of the European socialists. This conflict would take on its most bloody form in the 1918-19 Spartacus uprising at the end of the German revolution: once in power, the now wholly reformist SPD would brutally crush their revolutionist counterparts as they attempted to establish worker's states. Remember again that these were former comrades who, decades ago, would have relied on each other's cooperation.  So what does this have to do with authoritarianism in Russia? The leaders of the Russian revolution were internationalists, and had counted on the victory of the German revolutionaries and, hence, the victory of a sweeping revolution across the world. The hope was that, since Germany was among the foremost industrial powers of the world, it could provide material necessities and alleviate the stresses of war, in turn allowing for demilitarization and democratization across both Germany and Russia. This didn't happen-- again, the German revolutionaries were massacred by reformists. It's possible that the Bolsheviks miscalculated, or simply that the Bolsheviks had no other choice but to push forward and *hope* that Germany would turn around. Probably both. In any case, the ascendant Bolsheviks were left in a very, *very* difficult situation: they were in charge of a war-weary nation with hostile states (particularly now Germany) on all sides and powerful counterrevolutionaries within. Realistically there was only one thing they could do besides capitulate-- dig in, and use the full power of the state to survive for as long as possible.  Rosa Luxemburg summarizes this impasse pretty well in The Russian Tragedy (which is short but extremely useful in understanding the attitudes of communists at the time -- a must read!):  > The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the *German*, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies. ... **Such is the false logic of the objective situation: any socialist party that came to power in Russia today must pursue the wrong tactics so long as it, as part of the international proletarian army, is left in the lurch by the main body of this army.**  As an example of \"wrong tactics,\" Trotsky discusses in a report that the early Soviet worker's militia could not confront the vastly better-equipped and better-trained German army, nor even the relatively more experienced armies under White control. As a result, Trotsky was compelled to professionalize the army, institute harsh drafts, and even incorporate captured White officers at gunpoint just to win the civil war. Both he and Lenin recognized that these measures were counter to the principles of the revolution but were nonetheless necessary if the revolution were to survive at all.  As we now know, neither Germany nor any comparably industrialized country underwent a successful communist revolution. The Soviets would remain isolated long after Lenin's death, and Stalin would further entrench authoritarianism-- what started as emergency measures became standard procedure when the emergency never went away. (EDIT: This part feels a bit insufficient. I don't want to attribute the entrenchment of authoritarianism as something unique to Stalin as a person -- it was likely a combination of broad social forces and personality. I might point to the rising nationalism in Marxist reformists are an analogous process, but this would require a more detailed treatment of Stalin I am not really prepared to make.)  For subsequent revolutions, the \"fruit from a poisoned tree\" situation you described is sort of right-- these revolutions drew explicitly from Lenin's revolutionary measures and, sometimes less explicitly, from Stalin's entrenchment. One might even say that they were all part of a single, broader revolution, and can't be treated as isolated cases. Later on certain countries like Cambodia and North Korea would spin off on their own and abandon communism even in name, but since they faced the same problems of political isolation, they had at least an excuse to remain authoritarian.   It's probably not true that failure was inevitable, which would ignore the later history of Trotskyism and other oppositional forces in, most notably, the USSR and the China. But I don't want to spin off into counterfactuals-- things *could* have happened differently, but they didn't, and that's the question you're asking.  In summary:  * Pre-WW1 politics caused a deep rift between reformist and revolutionary factions in European socialism  * This led to the (short-term) success of the Russian revolution and the failure of the German revolution, as reformists were much more powerful in the latter country  * Without German support, the Russian Bolsheviks had to enact emergency authoritarian measures to remain afloat  * Later, the static international situation allowed authoritarianism to be entrenched  * Future revolutions would emulate the Bolsheviks and in turn face the same problems of political isolation  Note again that this is just a single perspective, taking into account mostly primary sources from the leaders of the Russian and German revolutions. Still, this is an important point of view I think, and the one I'm most familiar with.

Some companies have played that game so well that they pay nothing in taxes, and a handful get a net positive payment. Which is dumb.  More generally, corporate taxes are sold as a \"tax on the rich\" but that's not how it works. When companies are taxed they raise prices as much as they can so it isn't the company that pays the tax. No, I pay that tax. Yeah, the company sends in the check but I'm the one out the money. If the company can't raise prices because we collectively won't put up with that then it's the workers who are turned down for raises or don't get hired or might get laid off. If companies can get away with some 'belt tightening' to make their earnings numbers look better to investors then you bet your ass that belt is tightening.  It's only when neither of those things are possible, when prices are as high as they are going to go and the belt is as tight as it's going to get, when the person paying the tax is the shareholders of the company.

So, you hit retirees and current workers as much as you hit rich folks.  So, what tax does generally hit rich folks? Capital gains. Why? Because it's on the other side of the equation. It's taxing rich people directly where they can't shift its responsibility to anyone else. So, why is the Capital Gains rates lower? Well, there are two reasons. First is to encourage investment, a gentle nudge towards putting money to use instead of gold-filled swimming pools. And that does work... sorta... during specific parts of the business cycle. The other reason is a fairness argument. So, you make a dollar by owning a business, shrewd planning and a not insignificant amount of design work pays off. Only that $1 you made gets taxed 35% when it leaves the company and gets hit *again* when it enters your hand? Possibly as much as another 35% if we're using income tax brackets. Well, fuck that. The Federal government gets a full 70 cents on the dollar? And then States sometimes get another 15% and occasionally a city asks for 10%. So now, fuck.

Caste and divides between North and South means not only the social status and occupational position that you are born into but your potential marriage pool as well. This would suggest that due to social reasons groups might remain separate genetic populations even when living in the same region. The problem, of course, is that not everyone stays cleanly within their caste when they marry. Hypergamy (marrying up) is quite common for women. Even if you're only marrying slightly up (remember there are many sub-castes within the larger 4 casts plus untouchable group) over a few generations if each daughter marries up you can get those genes into a new caste. And prior to the arrival of the British the caste system was not nearly as formalized or rigid. However, this doesn't stop people from claiming the importance of genetic heritage and the importance of their heritage being distinct and set apart from others. We can see the same thing going on in European royal bloodline debates, for example.   There have been a lot of studies on the genetics of the huge range of culturally diverse communities in India.

Due in part to simplification for explaining things in intro type courses and the Hindu nationalism within India we sometimes think of India as relatively homogeneous. But there are huge ranges of religion, language, foodways, house types, art forms, and genetics. However, an important point from in the study I just linked is, **\"Studies based on mtDNA have shown that, among Indians, the basic clustering of lineages is not language- or caste-specific.\"** It goes on to say that the population separations that are noted seem to be fairly recent, which makes sense given the historical data we have. This study might be a good one to dispute arguments about how those cultural barriers play out in reality when it comes to sharing genes.   But more to your point about the Aryan-Dravidian divide, there is little genetic evidence. In fact, the genetic evidence suggests it is a load of bs. In fact, Brahmins do not have Central Asian genetic markers that you'd expect if this story line were true. And all Indians seem to show the same genetic ancestry with no sudden influx of genes around 3500 years ago when this supposedly happened."}, {"prefer": "It won't be \"soul crushing and life-ruining,\" but there are big opportunity costs.

Clearly certain environments like deserts and dry cold regions are better for preserving bodies. However, while we do have some frozen bodies of the Thule to examine there are significantly less than bodies from desert regions. So why? Well there was a 2000 study about a frozen Thule \"mummy\" that addresses this question.   > Although the frigid climate results in mummies frozen with remarkable preservation of outer appearance and microscopic detail, bodies are preserved only under extraordinary circumstances. The frozen ground makes winter burials impossible and the permafrost layer,only a few centimeters below the surface,discourages deep burials even in summer. Cycles of freezing and thawing tend to bring summer burials to the surface,exposing bodies to the ravages of animals and weather.  Burial traditions also play a role in what gets preserved. Many societies adapted to the realities of how difficult it was to bury bodies in frozen ground and simply used surface and platform burials which exposed the bodies much more than burying them does.   >  Platformand surface burials were common in Utqiagvik and other coastal whaling villages until the missionization that accompanied the historic period in the late 1890s. Grave often ac- starting goods companied these burials, typically consisting of personal tools for both men and women. At Pingusugrukon Point Franklin for instance,a woman from a prehistoric whaling village was placed on top of an abandoned kitchen with a skin tool kit that included stone blades and a lump of the red ochre used for trim coloring on parkas and other garments(Sheehanfieldnotes).Also at Pingusugruk, a woman from an earlier Thule settlement was covered by a musk ox skin in the tunnel entrance to an abandoned house (Jensenfieldnotes).  If you're curious, the article was about an autopsy of an 800 year old female child who seemed to have a lung disorder. Lung damage is a common find from communities that sleep and spend their days around fires so her black lungs weren't surprising. But they were damaged much more than they would expect and they suspect a particular lung disorder called AlAT deficiency. Her bones were very osteoporotic, which is common with other ancient Eskimo bodies due to metabolic acidosis from their meat heavy diet. She seemed to have died from starvation and in desperation had eaten dirt, pebbles, and chewed on animal hides (contemporary communities confirmed that when hungry parents often gave their kids animal hides to chew.) But she was a chronically ill child  and this also contributed to her death. She only made it as long as she did because her community cared for her and they suggest this was actually why her body was preserved - it was purposefully buried unlike most bodies.  Families typically stored extra meat by digging a bowl like cache under the house for storage. It was here that she was buried wrapped in a bird skin parka. She was also buried with a toboggan and length of rope, which they suggest might have been how her family transported her. This care resulted in her body being \"the best preserved prehistoric body ever recovered in Alaska.\"   (Just of note - the archaeologists who found her consulted the local Inuit elders who requested that they do an autopsy and treat the body like they would a modern day death. That meant finding out what happened but also handling her with respect and reburying her when finished.)"}, {"prefer": "Ok, I think I've got a reasonably plausible explanation. There are 2 important things in the design of a paper plane: Pitch Stability and Zero Lift Moment.  Pitch Stability first. A paper plane is basically a flat plate and flat plate aerofoils suffer from pretty horrendous pitching moments. To remain stable, the plane needs to be sufficiently nose heavy that the pitching force acts behind the centre of mass. Purely because it's stable, a plane can fly smoothly. It might smoothly veer sideways, or smoothly dive, but whatever it does will be reasonably smooth.  The next important thing is the Zero Lift Moment. For most paper planes you have a little bit of elevator flap at the back. This provides an upwards pitching moment when the plane is flying flat. The result of this is than instead of being pitch stable about 0 degrees, it's pitch stable about a small positive angle of attack. A flat plate with a small positive angle of attack provides lift, and you've got a working plane.  For a standard paper plane: All you need is to be pitch stable, with a small offset.  Now for our circular plane. Pitch stability is easy, all the weight is at the nose. But where does it get the offset from? How does it know to fly slightly upwards rather than in a smooth dive.  This is why it needs to spin. Because the nose is heavy, it would naturally fall forwards. But as it's spinning like a gyroscope, this forward tipping torque gets transformed into a small left (or right) rotation. Now it's flying at a tiny angle sideways, there's a torque restoring it to straight. Because its spinning this again gets transformed into a rotation upwards. The overall result is that what you should have a slight negative offset, but because its a gryoscope this ends up as a slight positive offset.  So to summarise for the circular plane: It's pitch stable like all good paper planes, and relies on gyroscopic effects to get a small pitch offset."}, {"prefer": "Sounds like the check may have been deposited twice.

In this school of thought the sugar has started to dissolve into the butter but you won't be able to see the dissolving and the mixture will still be grainy.  The second school of thought is that you should cream butter and sugar until the mixture lightens in color. This approach incorporates more air and results in more airy baked goods.  I personally fall into the first camp, and I call the second school of thought whipping (not creaming). If you use older recipes, they make the same creaming/whipping distinction that I do. But, many modern bloggers default to whipping their butter and calling it creaming.   For cookies (since this is cookie season), extra air in the butter will mean a more cake like cookie.

Take an older woman with long hair, cut it off above the shoulder and style it, and she instantly looks ten years younger, or at least more put-together for her age.   The other point here is that grey hair is different. It's coarser and tends to curl in strange ways, which makes it ill-suited to the long, silky, flowing thing that we expect from beautiful long hair. Long grey hair tends to make a woman look a bit like an unkempt old crone. Short haircuts keep grey hair craziness as contained as tidy as possible.

Estimates based on genetic data vary widely, but anthropological evidence suggests the first major migrations out of our species' African birthplace were between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.  That's not even a very direct way to answer this, actually, but I'll try to explain the intuitive idea behind it. Who are you more related to, your grandfather or your first cousin? Well, think about all the \"hops\" your genome has been through. Half your grandfather's genome hopped into your mother (we'll assume it's your maternal grandfather), and then half of that hopped into you. Two hops. Your *kinship coefficient*, the degree of relatedness between you (technically the probability that you have both inherited the same genetic material from the same origin - in this case your grandfather himself would be the origin) is 1/4.  To get to your first cousin, you have to hop up twice to your grandparents, then hop down again twice to the cousin, so four hops. What's the kinship coefficient? Well, it's actually 1/8, not 1/16, because although there were four hops, there were two different paths (one through your grandfather and one through your grandmother, since you have them in common).  So basically, one way of asking how related you are to any random human in the population is to ask how many generations ago your most recent common ancestor was. This number will vary widely; if you're both German, it's probably much more recent than if one of you is Korean and the other is from a tribe of !Kung San in the Kalahari desert, in which case you might have to trace your common origins all the way back to the first African humans.  ---  That said, it should still be very possible to estimate the average genetic distance between any two living humans, given all the data we've accumulated now. It could be trickier to model the hypothetical gene pool of humanity from 10,000 years ago, and I don't remember enough coalescent theory to do it myself, but I hope some pop-gen expert comes along soon because a lot of the answers in this thread are just naive math that's obviously wrong."}, {"prefer": "Defense.

One problem is that the F-35 is actually three aircraft pretending to be one. I haven't actually looked at the numbers, but if you divide the cost of the program by three, I doubt it's still the most expensive weapons program in history. So, I bet the cost problems are exaggerated to some extent because journalists never actually know what they're talking about.  Multi-role doesn't really overload a modern fighter with too many requirements, but trying to be three different jets at once clearly does. There are just too many compromises that have to be made in order to keep some semblance of part interchangeability between the different versions.  As far as performance, I think the main problem is that the \"all-stealth air force\" idea is a stupid one. Stealth is great, but it's more of a niche technology. For instance, a stealth air superiority fighter is a great idea. A stealth deep strike or SEAD aircraft is also a great idea. However, stealth makes a lot less sense for a lot of ground-attack missions, and pretty much no sense for CAS.   The design constraints placed on the F-35 by the stealth design prevent it from being as good at these roles as people expected it to be. It simply can't carry enough stuff internally to be able to do missions the same way the F-16 or F-18 can. Those are more successful as multi-role aircraft because you can load them very heavily for a strike mission, or load them more lightly for an air superiority mission. The F-35 had to be designed lightly for the air superiority mission, but then fattened so it had a prayer of doing ground-attack. But because of the stealth restrictions, it can't do a very good job of that mission. So it ends up being an all-round turd.  The other problem is the classic American acquisitions problem of asking for the moon. They decide to include all these nonexistent technologies as key features of the new aircraft. You end up with a hybrid production-design/research project. Research projects always take longer than you expect, which means going over-budget. But now you're doing your research on a full production scale, which means instead of spending $4 million when you thought it would be $2 million, those numbers start with a 'b'.

I think this is a common misconception that there's a lot of sitting around thinking for theoretical physics, because we're not actually physically fiddling with experimental equipment and what not.  While, yes, a lot of thought has to go into what we're doing, you're right, we're not all having miraculous break throughs all the time (as much as we like to think we are!)  As for the day to day, it really depends on what area of physics you work in. One way it can work, is that someone will do an experiment, and there'll be some unexpected thing happening, or a result they can't explain. Along comes your friendly neighbourhood theoretical physicist, armed with a bunch of equations that we know *should* describe the system. We can then combine extra effects and try to derive an equation to explain what's being seen in the experiments.  Other times it works slightly differently. Maybe you want to know what parameters are actually useful to look at in an experiment. For example, I work in quantum transport, and one of my jobs is to look at an electron, look at all of the ways that electron in a certain system can interact with that system, and then figure out a model that the experimentalists can use to figure out what the best parameters are for their design.   Other people do a lot more numerical simulations, and their day to day will look a lot more like sitting down at a computer, and coding up ways to visualise physics that we otherwise wouldn't be able to study, or, again, modelling experiments to help test and explore the physics.

You derive an equation, based on what we know, (this is where a lot of the traditional image of physicist at chalk board probably comes in, although we do that for all areas of physics) , you make some approximations (physicists love approximations), so that you can have a version of your equation that you can look at and go \"OK, if I make that number bigger, that number gets smaller, that means that this, this and this happens,\" so it's a quick way to see physical behaviour. Then, you can code up your full version and check to see how closely your approximations match, to make sure they're actually useful/find out where they stop working etc.  I hope that answer wasn't too long winded and was actually helpful! Like I said, it's very subject dependent. This is my experience of theoretical physics so far (final year PhD student), but this might well differ for others!

Not to worry. We'll get you brought up to speed on why our fleet is built this way, where we're going with it, and what we plan to do to plug this little... problem you've noticed.  The first thing is to remember that while we are the Imperial Navy, quite a bit of our hardware and doctrine are a result of the disastrous clone wars and the collapse of the old republic. Older ships like the Venator class carried large wings of starfighters, but were comparatively poorly armed in ship to ship combat. At the same time, starfighters of that era really weren't a proper threat to capital ships. Oh, in large enough numbers they could do some damage, I grant you, but they really weren't a threat. Separatist ships, as well as the ships used by other mongrel forces on the rim were often poorly shielded, but carried heavy firepower that could mission kill if not destroy a Venator or an Acclimator in short order.  As a result of the founding of our New Order, the Imperial Navy made the design decision to roll out our Imperial I and II SD's to reinvigorate our fleet and give it a proper ship to ship punch, as well as reduce the vulnerability of our troop transports. Finally, it was also decided (in order to properly take advantages of the economies of scale that we are afforded by key contractors such as Sinear and Kuat), to work to build a single \"one ship fits all\" solution. That gets us our Imperial Star Destroyer. While Grand Moff Tarkin was rolling out his doctrine, (and it does dovetail nicely in with the ISD's design concepts), the ISD as a whole came first by several years. That's why they're everywhere.  At the same time, the effectiveness of hordes of light fighters wasn't entirely lost on us, and the simple truism is that a fighter or ship can only ever be on one place at any one time. So our focus on rolling out TIE fighters allows us to field large numbers in any engagement. While yes, they aren't the equal of rebel designs (which were in fact designed thanks to funding BY the Imperial Navy, before the design teams defected) on a one to one basis, they provide significant benefits during other-than-fleet-action operations. TIE fighters can be providing top cover while conducting ground operations, provide support for customs teams, and be standing roving patrols all while maintaining a sufficient reserve to account for maintenance downtimes.  I understand that at this time, this is rather cold comfort when your ships are having to deal with rebel hit and fade attacks, but that is the galaxy we're living in. Were the past different, we may already have begun to field comparable fighters to the rebel X-Wing multirole fighter.   Ah. I'm sure you've noticed that little turn of phrase there. \"May already\". We here at Fleet Command aren't entirely blind to the problem these rag tag rebels have revealed, and we are indeed working on countermeasures. But introducing new fighters or other doctrines take time. We have to be able to support the hardware we put into the field, otherwise we might as well blow it up ourselves and save the trouble of the rebels swooping in and destroying it and Vader knows what else!  But I digress. I'm afraid we cannot disclose any more than that. Please stay up to date as new information comes down from Command via your holonet fleet updates, and continue to suppress and crush any rebel forces you encounter. Remember, it's Moffs like you that help keep the Empire moving forward to Victory!

The below is meant to just highlight some areas that different objections can be pursued; it's not meant to be some standalone \"final word\" on the matter. I put this disclaimer at the beginning because I am not interested in \"debating\" responses to the below (as some people *really* want to when they read the below, though I'm happy to try and clarify things); I'm merely highlighting different avenues that have been pursued.  So: Much of this will certainly depend on exactly how utilitarianism is cashed out.  So, first, let's get a general statement of utilitarianism on the board. How about this: \"an act is right if and only if it maximizes happiness in the world.\" Now, we could get more precise, but we can use that as a working understanding. As you note, things might change if we move to preference-utilitarianism, or rule utilitarianism   Here are some of the issues that the utilitarian has to contend with:  1. Utilitarianism looks to make the notion of \"rights\" obsolete. For instance, tossing Christians to the lions in ancient Rome is bad for the Christian, but good for the Colosseum of Romans who are in ecstasy at the spectacle. If you have enough ecstatic Romans, then it looks like it's good, given utilitarianism, to toss the Christian to the lions.   2. Utilitarianism is too demanding. It seems to demand that that we always are to maximize happiness, in every action, at all times. And that's very, very, hard-- and hard in a way that seem to be too much of a cost for a moral theory.  3. Utilitarianism tries to put a single metric on value, and that's incoherent. Can we really compare the sort of value you assign to the life of your wife, with the value you assign to eating a Twinkie, with the value you assign to relieving yourself, with the value you assign to living the life of monk? For many people, it does not seem that all things that we value in life can be compared. e.g. I value twinkies. I also value my wife. How many twinkies is my wife worth to me? Utilitarianism asks questions like that all the time; for many people the question is ridiculous as a comparison is impossible. Some things differ in kind, not just in quantity. The point to be made is that the utilitarian assigns a single metric to all value, and that seem incoherent. The utilitarian says that the type of value got from scratching an itch is commensurable with the value of my wife. So, there will exist a relationship, such that some number times the value of itching a scratch equals the value of my wife. But, we might say, any equation looks wrong here. As Kant says, life has a dignity, and not just a price. The sorts of value involved here are incommensurable, if comparable.  4. Utilitarianism is under-specified, and when it is specified, those specifications are largely arbitrary. For instance, do we maximize aggregate happiness, or average happiness? Who is included? People, animals, future generations? How do we weigh \"high probability of little pleasure\" vs \"low probability of high pleasure\"? Here's another problem: assuming we can calculate the relevant utils, how do we deal with time? Do we look a second ahead, a year ahead or a century ahead? But why stop at a century? Why not 101 years, or 500 years or 865.324 years, or the second before all sentient beings are extinct? The normative prescription provided by utilitarianism can change from instant to instant. So what do you make of a theory that tells you that a certain action will produce a net +10 utils at time t, a net -5 utils at t+1, a net +100 utils at t+2, a net -1000 utils at t+3, etc, etc? If net utility can change from instant to instant (and it obviously can), then utilitarianism is of no service to moral agents in deciding how to act or how to value an action.  5. Utilitarianism seems to be a self-effacing theory in that there seem to be situations where making utilitarianism the publicly accepted moral system would actually produce less utility. So, utilitarianism might very well be a theory that works best if no one is thinking about it....very odd.  6. Related to 5. Utilitarianism tells us that an act is right if and only if it is optimific in regard to pleasure and pain. But you can't embody this reason in your motive for acting, and still have friends, loved-ones, etc. Under utilitarianism, you don't value your friends as *friends*, you value them as sources of pleasure; they are replaceable -- anything with the same effects on us will suffice. So, when you try to embody utilitarianism in your motives, you find that the person you supposedly love engages your thought not for him/her but as a source of pleasure. To embody in one's motives the values of utilitarianism is to treat people externally and to preclude love, affection, community. To get *these* goods while holding utilitarianism requires a schizophrenia between reason and motive. To the extent that you live utilitarianism, you will fail to achieve goods like friendship, love, inquiry -- and these are goods that the utilitarian himself recognizes as good. The objection is that you cannot embody your reason in your motives, as a utilitarian. The utilitarian says that friends, and love are goods. But you can't achieve these goods, while simultaneously embodying your reason in your motive.            Compare to the egoist: egoists take their own pleasure as the sole justification. From this, they should recognize the love, etc as among personal pleasures; so they have good reason on their own grounds to enter such relations. But when they act on their motive of pleasure-for-self they can't get those pleasures; to achieve these pleasures they have to abandon their egoistical motive; the egoist can't get the pleasures of love and friendship. For it is essential to the very concept of love that one care for the beloved, and be prepared to act for the sake of the beloved as a final goal. But to the extent that my consideration for you comes from my desire to lead a life that is personally pleasing, I do not act for your sake. So their motive and reasons pull apart. So, to get these goods they have to lead a sort of schizophrenic life.       Here's sort of how Susan Wolf understands the point: the utilitarian values these things only because of and insofar as they are a part of the general happiness. He values them under the description, “a contribution to the general happiness.” In contrast, real people might love, say, literature, because of the insights into human nature, or, growing roses because they are beautiful. Sure this may contribute to happiness, but this isn't the point to the non-utilitarian. For if one values these activities in more direct ways, one may not be willing to exchange them for others that produce an equal, or even greater amount of happiness. From that point of view, it is not because they produce happiness that these activities are valuable; it is because these activities are valuable in more direct and specific ways that they produce happiness. So, the utilitarian can't value things in the right way.   So, those are some basic problems. I should note, though, that utilitarians are smart people, and can give responses-- indeed, utilitarians have given responses, but the above is just supposed to be the basic sorts of issues that lead to needed refinement/argument. One of the big responses you'll see is that \"utilitarianism is not a decision procedure!\" By this, the utilitarian means that you should take the theory as reporting when actions are \"good\" and when they are \"bad.\" So, on this reading, we shouldn't use the theory of utilitarianism to decide how to act on particular occasions. (Indeed, many utilitarians grant that, in deciding how to act, it is counterproductive to consult the theory of utilitarianism). Moreover, just because it's difficult to determine what action maximizes happiness isn't a mark against the theory -- it just shows we are limited in our knowledge. Moreover, utilitarians will be utilitarian about how they assign praise and blame. So, for instance, say I jump in the water and, unbeknownst to me, save Hitler Jr., who goes to murder a bunch of people. Well, utilitarians might still praise my act as the right one (since, they want to promote saving drowning folk), even though my action was actually \"bad\" (since it led to a decrease in utility). Another way to see the same point: just because I do a bad action, doesn't mean I should be blamed for it, since whether or not I'm to be blamed is something we have to think about along utilitarian lines.  Some of the more spelled out versions of utilitarianism are interesting and deep. But, the sort of utilitarianism you sometimes see in economics, law, public policy, may be \"too quick.\"  It may have a certain air of \"spurious rigour,\" where we mistake quantification and calculation for cogency of thought. It might be a great moral theory for omniscient beings (though even this is in question). But for those of us who lack that quality, utilitarianism may be seen as just a device to cloak moral bias with the guise of mathematical certainty. There's definitely more to be said, but I'll end there for now."}, {"prefer": "Not all carbs are equal.  The two act very differently  when consumed.

The donor site will heal the skin because there is still a partial layer of skin left behind that includes hair follicles and sweat glands, which is where new skin cells come from.  “Full thickness skin grafts” are what they sound like: full thickness. The skin cannot heal upwards from the bottom and would need to heal inwards from the sides. So when surgeons take full thickness skin, they suture the wound edges together. Then it heals like any surgical incision or cut you get.  Split thickness is more common because you can take very large grafts and the skin will heal. You can’t take large full thickness grafts because you wouldn’t be able to sew the edges together with a wound so large. Also full thickness skin grafts have a more difficult time “taking.”  You may be asking regarding split thickness skin grafts: why make a new wound just to cover an existing wound? Because the kinds of existing wound we do this for won’t heal well by itself. If you put a skin graft on it, the existing wound will heal well, and the new wound will heal well.  Edit: since a lot of people are mentioning meshing I thought I’d add a blurb about it too. We often mesh split thickness skin grafts. This serves two purposes: 1) the graft can cover a larger surface area, and 2) fluid that would otherwise build up under the skin graft has a place to escape. If that fluid stayed there the graft would not stick and it would die. Meshing the graft does cause more scarring and contracture when it heals, and so it’s not well suited for cosmetic areas like the face or mobile joints like the hand. If we don’t mesh the graft I have to stick a syringe in it every so often to suck out the fluid that builds up underneath."}, {"prefer": "Project Lead: Can you look at this request for proposal and tell me your approach and estimated hours.

My housing cost was about a wash, for you I imagine anywhere you can go it would be much cheaper than the bay area.   On the flip side I was not able to contribute to any US retirement accounts, so my retirement account is missing a few years of contributions, and since I’m still young this can impact my   future significantly. I don’t think what I put into a German pension came anywhere near what I would’ve put into my 401k in the US, and I certainly wont get as much out as if I was managing the account myself.   The city I lived in is basically always ranked in the top 5 cities for quality of life in the world for any year I have looked and I believe it.   The company I worked at was very focused on keeping employees happy, and very big on work life balance. In Germany in general it was illegal for me to work more than 10 hours a   day, I had to get special authorization to work on Saturdays (which never happened anyways), and it was completely illegal for me to work Sundays. It was also illegal for my average work load over a few months to be above 40 hours a week. I also had the option to work 35 hours a week, of course getting paid for 5 less hours a week, along with prorated vacation benefits.  When I got this offer and told my US company I was going to accept, they said “how does anybody get anything done out there with all these laws” which really put in my mind the difference in focus on individual vs company for me.   I wanted to get out there and travel while I was still young, and until covid lockdowns it was a great experience for me, and for me it was worth taking the pay cut to live out there.

Rape is a very hard charge to prove, as most cases come down to \"he said, she said\". This is why externalities - such as dress, behavior, etc. - are used to help determine who is telling the truth. These have been attacked in recent years, because they inherently remove agency from a woman - as in, wearing tight clothing does not mean that the woman wants to have sex, and it especially does not mean that she doesn't have the right to change her mind about sex between when she puts it on and when the two individuals are alone.   Yes, false rape allegations happen. The rate at which they happen is rather disputed, because it is difficult to distinguish between a false charge and a true charge where we don't have sufficient evidence to convict. Remember, convictions require evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and in many situations a jury can reasonably doubt that the sex was not consensual.   So knowing that, imagine that you are a woman who has been raped, perhaps by an acquaintance or a spouse, with no witnesses or evidence to show that it was not consensual. Do you make a report, in the hopes that he will confess or that evidence might exist to prove he committed the crime, or to try and establish a pattern of behavior so that he won't get away with it in the future (or even just for your own peace of mind)? Or do you refrain from making a report, because you'll probably be charged and/or convicted under the law against false rape charges?  On the whole, the fear of prosecution would reduce the number of rape allegations, both real ones and fake ones. That's not what we want. If you think that's hyperbolic, look at the case of prostitutes. Violence against prostitutes and escorts is quite common, but those crimes are seldom reported, as the women are afraid of being prosecuted for their sex work instead of being taken seriously as a victim.

And then this sets up a larger argument extending through the transcendental analytic, according to which geometry is then a pure science of the relations holding between spatial things, so that we can know apodictically that physical things must be adequate to geometrical description, and this thereby furnishes us with an epistemology justifying one of the methodological peculiarities of modern physics.  The way these issues develop in the critical response developed from Helmholtz through Mach to logical positivism is that philosophers will increasingly distinguish different senses of space: intuitive space, as the space of our imagination and visual perception; formal space, as the space constructable in geometry; and physical space, as the space of physical relations.  The challenge is that these senses seem to be collapsed, or at least intrinsically connected, on Kant's view. As, on Kant's view, it seems that intuitive space provides the conditions for formal space and these two jointly provide the conditions for physical space, such that if intuitive space is Euclidean, then so must formal and physical space be.  Whereas, on the critical reception, these three senses of space become more independent. I.e., on this later view, it could be that intuitive space is Euclidean, but that doesn't mean formal space has to be, and indeed it seems that mathematicians can construct a variety of formal spaces, including both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. And since this freedom of mathematicians permits us to think of these different spaces, there is likewise a freedom in physics to choose which of them is adequate to the demands of physical theory, as happens in the choice of non-Euclidean geometry for space as constructed in general relativity.  Underpinning this move is the rejection of Kant's dual-source model of knowledge which categorically distinguished between intuition and understanding as joint bases of cognition, and which manifests in the distinction in Kant's epistemology between the transcendental aesthetic and transcendental analytic. On Kant's view, this mooring of understanding to intuition, as joint factors, restricts the capacity of the understanding to posit mathematical structures to those which can be exhibited in intuition. Conversely, on the later view when the understanding has been unmoored from a supposedly distinct doctrine of intuition, it is free to construct whatever mathematical structures can be grounded on merely the principles of conceptual construction as such.  And then the experimental challenge would be: if it turns out that scientific findings demand this later approach, then this would provide us with a prima facie reason to prefer it over Kant's."}, {"prefer": "Can I cheat and give an essay collection?

The 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic had two waves, with those who had contracted the flu in the first wave gaining immunity to the flu during the second wave. The second wave did result in more fatalities than the first wave, but that was due to the virus mutating to a deadlier strain which was then spread primarily by soldiers being transported to crowded hospitals on crowded trains whilst soldiers with the milder strain remained near the front line.  This second wave killing off more of the population results in less viable hosts to carry the virus. The elderly, who are typically prime candidates for other flu strains, had picked up partial immunity to the 1918 strain of H1N1 from the 1898-1905 outbreaks of the H3N8 “Russian flu” subtype. With most of the adults either already infected/dead, being treated for the flu, or already immune from the first wave, it essentially caused what has been termed social distancing during the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) - hosts were unable to encounter fresh hosts for the virus and, without a host and being an obligate parasite, the virus begins to die off.  Mutation, not to a deadlier strain, but to a milder strain, is also another factor. This occurs genetically when the virus is not encountering as many hosts, thus having to mutate to cause milder symptoms so that hosts with the new milder strain will spread it more easily. However, it’s easier to recover from a mild strain than a severe one, so still fewer people died from the 1918 H1N1 strain.  These factors, combined with medical treatment of flu sufferers, made the 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic a flash in the pan (compared to other pandemics - smallpox, bubonic plague, and so on); it was virulent, but it was short-lived. It was short-lived because it was virulent, it was almost *too* good at what it did, to the point that the virus ran out of viable hosts to continue the pandemic.  Now, none of that is to say that H1N1 is gone, it isn’t. H1N1 was responsible for the 2009 swine flu outbreak, as well as avian flu (A/duck/Alberta/35/76 - Influenza type A/origin: duck/found in Alberta, Canada/ strain 35/ identified in 1976), and is ever-present in a small percentage of the human population.

The darker areas, Lunar mare (mare is latin for sea) is formed for a volcanic eruption. They are younger with an avrage of 3-3-5 billion year old, the youngest are around 1.2 billion years old. There are fewer crates in the mares and it is by counting crates that ages of the youngest part are counted.  So the surface of the moon has been unchanged for billion of years with the exception of impacts. Nothing will destroy them except other impaces.  So we can see lots of impact on the moon because we can see all that have been formed for billions of years.  Earths surface is continuously changing.  The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater that a result of the impact that is a major part of the extension of non-avian dinosaurs is practically invisible today.

If you compare to craters on the moon there are 70 larger than this. So a what would be a large crater on the moon can't be visually detected on earth after 66 million years. The youngest part of the moon surface is 18x as old and the oldest pars 63x as old. The number of impacts has decreased over time in the solar system.   Something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater that is clearly a crate is only 50 000 years old and is in a desert.

What is really going on here is that, for small angles, the motion of a pendulum is relatively easy for us to describe with basic mathematics.

It wasn't one of the fancier pressurized ones, just a middle of the road one, but one with 8 cup (note: not standard American cup size, more like 3/4 cup or 1 serving) capacity.    The first time I made regular short grain (sushi) rice in it, I was actually pretty amazed at how great the texture was.  It was perfectly cooked, e.g. no mushy areas or over dried areas.  My old cheap rice cooker that I got for $10 or $20 was so inconsistent, sometimes I got rice that was too mushy or sometimes it was too hard.  Frankly, sometimes I am even lazy with watching how accurately I fill the water up to the line in the pot and it still comes out perfect.  I think the taste is definitely better.  I use mine about once or twice a week, or at the very least, once every two weeks.  It was definitely worth the initial investment, because it is easy to clean, makes all kids of rice perfectly (imho), can be set to cook at a certain time of day, and keeps rice warm for quite a long time without changing the texture (two settings on that too, keep warm long or short amount of time).  I use it probably about as often as I use an oven, so logically it is a good investment.  Fuzzy logic means that it measures the temperature of the rice while cooking and adjusts the heat accordingly.  I think that it's a major part in the great consistency it always puts out.  The pressurized induction part, I am not sure if you would be able to improve on how well it already does with just the fuzzy logic, but I have never tried rice from one of the fancier ones, so I can't really say.

A person who spends thousands of hours practicing and improving their ability to play chess doesn't actually improve their ability to remember strings of numbers.  They might be able to recite back the last 15 moves of the game they're playing, or have the entire board pictured in their head as they play blind folded, yet give them non-related memory tasks and they are no better then average.  Another thing that hasn't been mentioned is that when it comes to many skills, people tend to just stop improving after a while unless they put in deliberate effort.  The easiest example of this is typing speed.  People get better as they type more for a while, and then tend to stall at a relatively low speed unless they deliberately pursue something like typing lessons.  When you say that age should automatically equal respect, you bake in the assumption that the older you are, the more experienced you are.  What you neglect to account for though is that experience may only matter in a relatively narrow set of situations.  Let's say I own a bar.  If I ask my grandparents how I should market that bar, I'm sure they'll have opinions to give me.  If I ask a guy who has spent the last 2 years studying bar-marketing, he'll also have opinions to give me.  My grandparents have a lot more general life experience, but the marketer specializing in this field is clearly the better person to defer to.  Let's say instead of a bar, I have a tech company.  We're a software-as-a-service outfit specializing in text-message based marketing.  If I ask a group of 60 year old advertising agency executives how to market this, and then I ask a group of 20-somethings who've been doing online marketing for 3 years how to market this, I'm likely to get very different answers.  The older advertising agency executives might have 30 years each in advertising behind them.  They've done radio, TV, direct mail, etc.  The younger web solutions group may only have 3 years each, specializing in cost-per-click, web copywriting, web design and usability.  I think both groups would have important insights, but I would never ignore the younger web-focused group just because the ad agency has been around 10 times longer.  The younger group has more experience with situations very close to my problem, whereas the older group has general, broad-based experience but may or may not understand the nuances of this specific medium.  So how does this tie back into what your saying?  When it comes to ethical and personal choices, very few people deliberately practice to improve, and so I would expect people's talent there to peak at a relatively young age.  I wouldn't expect a 50 year old to automatically be a better authority on moral issues then a 25 year old.  When it comes to business or work decisions, although people gain a lot of experience in a certain set of situations, I'm not convinced the skills gained 'transfer' as much as we intuitively believe.  Given all that, there is some merit to the idea that you should only automatically defer to older people in some area if they have a legitiment claim to closely-related expertise.  Now young people who have no closely-related expertise are in a similar no-automatic respect situation, and if your going to be working together, there is a strong argument to be made that if they don't know very much, they should defer up the hierarchy.  But that's not an age based deference, that's a position based deference.  That's not so much due to some owed respect, rather that is the case for efficiency reasons.  If everyone argues with their supervisors whenever they kind of vaguely suspect they know better, then they will waste a lot of time and energy doing non-productive things.  Even if the more junior person is right, if the issue is such a marginal one as to make no real difference, then it's not an issue worth bringing up.  edit: To quickly add to this, the times I've most often witnessed blatant disregard for the respect deserved to a position was in university classes when mature students were present and monopolizing a professors time during class, and work situations where a younger person is supervising an older person."}, {"prefer": "Because that isn't the only piece of information your brain uses.

Over the course of your life you have lots of experience with seeing various objects and your brain develops an expectation of their size.

Not having a super hero identity is the exception rather than the rule, so let's look at a few prominent cases:  * MCU Tony Stark - Ego. Pure ego. This explicitly puts him and his companions in danger which he later comes to regret and is motivation for a lot of his future ideas and upgrades. But at the time he \"came out\" it was basically narcisissm. * MCU Thor - Thor lives on Asgard and his human friends are mostly superheroes.

A guy like Pip or Rawdon Crawley wouldn't be allowed to fleece you forever, unless you let them--and if Sir Richard Dastardly was rich enough, sometimes you would just let it slide for a little bit. If they \"paid you in exposure\" and sent their (possibly more solvent) friends to you to buy suits or dresses, you might let it slide for a little while, just to be neighborly and keep the peace. But if you were doing House of Worth work for pawnshop pay, you'd eventually get fed up. You'd start sending duns/debt collectors to knock on their door, hoping the annoyance and potential shame would convince them to pony up. At this point, he might contract with a moneylender for a promissory note; the lender would pay you and charge Dastardly interest, and Dastardly would be out of your hair.  If your debtor doesn't find a way to pay you, your next step is prosecution. You want Sir Richard to actually show up for the trial, so you bring legal action against him and pay a shilling for an arrest warrant. A sheriff's officer serves the warrant and will take Sir Richard Dastardly to a sponging house. There, you have some time to settle or you'll end up on trial/in jail.  If it gets to trial, and Dastardly is found to be a debtor, they stick him in jail. You can't just take his stuff, however, not yet -- he still has to decide to pay you, by selling his own stuff or borrowing money from family and friends. Rawdon Crawley never gets to this point, but a number of Dickens characters did. Usually, if you ended up in debtor's prison, you were already poor--not a Sir Richard Dastardly. Typically, a person with a title would have resources: they could sell land, a horse, beg Auntie for cash, or marry some wealthy heiress. If you were poor and in debtor's prison, you did have some light at the end of the tunnel: you could still ply certain trades from within prison, and you could eventually hope to get out. But it was miserable and difficult to drag oneself out of that debt hole. (Imprisonment for debt was abolished in 1869.)  Now, as to your question, \"Did they care?\" I think they cared about as much as we do. Victorians were a little more moralistic than we are now in that they were generally more likely to judge their neighbors as \"bad\" than put the circumstance ahead of their judgment -- but a lot of their attitudes are similar to today's. Being a serial debtor was more personal to the Victorians than it is to us, because there were, with the possible exception of the East India Company, no giant faceless monolithic companies to which you would owe money. You'd owe money to Bob the tailor and Joe the greengrocer, guys who lived probably within a few miles' radius of your own house, not to MasterCard. No one goes hungry if you don't pay MasterCard, but a Victorian person refusing to make good on his debts was literally taking money away from his neighbors, which was a bad look. Tongues would start wagging when the debt collectors came knocking, and a Sir Richard type might find himself not invited to as many parties as before. If he had romantic prospects, they could dry up: the father of a young lady isn't going to want his daughter hooking up with a spendthrift who'll end up in prison and will be unable or unwilling to provide for his family. If he's part of a gentleman's club, depending on how bad his money woes are (and whether or not all the other men in his club have similar attitudes towards money), he could find himself kicked out.   There were jerks, con men, liars, and people who had \"f-you\" amounts of money where they could gleefully skip town on Bob the Tailor and not care. There were no credit scores in the time period, but all you had was your name. If you developed a reputation as a sketchball, tailors wouldn't want to do work for you on credit anymore--no matter who you were. Tailors for the most part couldn't afford to give their work away for free. You'd have to pay cash. If you had cash, this wouldn't actually be a big deal, which is why a lot of wealthier people might only care about their debts insofar as their reputation could be affected. If Bob didn't want to play ball anymore, they'd just pay Bob the cash and get credit from some other poor slob. If you didn't have cash, this would be a serious issue for you. Some \"wealthy\" people didn't actually have \"ready money,\" only large fixed assets like land or houses, which they would then have to mortgage or sell if they'd tanked their reputation/credit, or who were known to be out of money even if they'd never had a debt problem. Like today, a lot of \"rich people\" were cash-poor, and kept an appearance of wealth by leveraging what they did have to get more.

What *that* means is our bodies do not have the proper enzymes to break it down, thus it passes through our bodies undigested. This is the same reason humans can't subsist on grass, our bodies do not have the enzymes necessary to process cellulose, which is the main sugar polymer (a string of sugars connected together) in plants.  As to whether it is harmful? The lack of calories is not a problem. Other than that, nobody can know for certain, but food additives such as aspartame and sucralose are some of the most studied molecules, almost on the level of drugs. There are no immediate health problems associated with artificial sweeteners, however there are myriad studies cropping up recently proposing certain long term health effects that may be tied to sweeteners.

Dried yeast comes in two types, granules which are pure dehydrated yeast (often referred to as 'active' or 'dry active') and fast acting (sometimes called 'instant'), which also contains ascorbic acid, a flour treatment agent.  Fast acting yeast is made up of much smaller grains and therefore doesn't need to be dissolved in water first. The ascorbic acid basically mimics many of the positive effects on dough structure from longer fermentation, giving a stronger dough in a shorter time, both through kneading and proof.  Dried yeast, contrary to what many may say, doesn't actually need to rehydrate for very long at all - just until it dissolves so it can mix evenly through the dough. Lots of traditional methods for breads made from commercial yeast are updates on sourdough or beer balm (essentially the yeast taken from beer fermentation tanks), which often use a batter-like first stage. This continued, essentially to check the yeast was still good but serves no real purpose otherwise.  There is actually a lot more to it with many different strains of yeast for different purposes, even within baking but largely those aren't available for domestic use."}, {"prefer": "I think for most of us in the West, it's easy to slip into seeing \"colonize and evangelize\" as the default setting. Our Western Civ II/World Civ II class *starts* with that as the foundational principle in its triumphant Story Of Civilization. In fact, with a variety of exceptions, Christianity and Islam had spent a solid number of centuries quite comfortably expanding through attrition in conquered territories. The ideal of evangelizing militancy in what John O'Malley has dubbed \"Early Modern Catholicism\" is exceptional--not the other way around. And to a much greater extent than our textbooks like to admit, *successful* militant evangelization was an even further exception.  Christian Europeans had spent the fifteenth century making, well, European Christianity. It was the Church's first full-court press to teach *everyone* in Christian society the basic fundamentals of what now had a name: \"the Christian faith.\" That's not to overblow the 14th century as \"pagan\" or whatever, just to stress how *dedicated* large swathes of the 15th century Church were to religious instruction of the laity. The Ten Commandments, the seven deadly sins, the meaning of the sacraments, how to die a good death so you go to heaven, reading the Bible (in the vernacular...except in England) to your family after a post-Mass meal, &c.  Individual-level religious enthusiasm is a big part of this in many cases, from leaders on down. It was especially aided by an utterly ubiquitous belief that the world was going to end RIGHT NOW...no, NOW...no, but that's *definitely* the Antichrist over there. It makes the looming Day of Judgment very real and very soon. It's easy to bleed this over into *collective* religious enthusiasm--the desire to save other people's souls, too.  There are other factors in play, especially the inexorable onward march of the medieval push towards order in society. Sumptuary laws regulating what people of different social statuses are and aren't allowed to wear is a very visible example. Religion is another big one, though. You'll recall that other thing that happened in 1492--Isabella and Ferdinand forced all Jewish Spaniards to choose between conversion to Christianity or immediate exile. This isn't *just* anti-Semitism for the sake of anti-Semitism, although it's that too; subsequent actions of Spanish inquisitors put in action the often-stated paranoia that Jewish people will sneakily de-convert New Christians. A big threat to Church and state authority!  So we head into the sixteenth century with Western Europe tipping into *internal* militant evangelization. You can then think of Martin Luther and his rinkadink regional Reformation as one among many contemporary reform movements. Several of those being, as traditional in medieval Christianity, *reformacio* of monastic life. Most relevantly here, that means the creation of the Jesuits and Ursulines, and the streamlining and outward turn of Observant mendicant orders. In addition to personal, internal spiritual renewal, the new and revived orders aimed to really, REALLY get Christians to be, well, Christian, and in a more sober and knowledgeable way than some of the more colorful aspects of late medieval devotion.  *Now* we can pitch this into wider context. The Church had long seen itself as an international government, operating within and beyond secular ones. Participation in colonialist expansion to the west and south and very east was important to it for mundane reasons as well as spiritual ones. One strategy absolutely was to plant convents of European nuns (especially) and monks as a way of claiming territory. But the other was to try to convert Indigenous populations to Christianity as an extension of the way Europe was being \"converted.\"  And that's the happy triumphant success narrative, and we point to modern Mexican Catholicism and the recent canonization of Kateri Tekakwitha and say, \"Sounds plausible.\" In reality, there were a whole lot of jagged steps forwards and backwards. You're probably familiar with That Ugly Time Europeans Decided To Formally Debate Whether Indigenous Americans Are Human, a question intimately wrapped up with whether they should be targets for conversion or not.   In some cases, Christianity blended into native religion and native religion blended into Christianity. Sometimes this *didn't* happen, and colonialist Inquisitors thought it had anyway and persecuted Americans for witchcraft. In Catholic Europe, meanwhile, the Inquisition was frequently targeting people it identified as \"crypto-Jews\"--essentially, people they believed were adopting a veneer of Christianity while retaining their non-Christian religion for keeps. We're talking about an Early Modern Catholicism here, not mission versus home Christianity. And sometimes, friars kind of just shrugged and said maybe mission wasn't really that important to the Church in the first place.  European imperialist expansion happened at a very specific time in western religious history. To be a Christian had become *defined as* more than just baptism and reciting the right words at your godchildren's baptisms; making a territory Christian needed to mean more than mass baptism or even baptism of the leaders. Whether imperialist conquest, diplomatic encounter (hi, China!), or cleaning up one's own backyard, the making of Christians was of primary importance to large segments of the Catholic Church.  They had the money, the power, and the government support in the interests of order and control to back up their mission of saving souls with the apocalypse just over the horizon."}, {"prefer": ">How did that belief change into the modern view that people who die and go to heaven will stay in heaven eternally?  Both beliefs have existed simultaneously since ancient times and survive today. Let's start with a look into the origin of the former. When the Israelites were exiled from Palestine by Babylon in the 6th century BCE, returning to that land became a major theme in their scriptures. This is the purpose of Ezekiel's vision of the Valley Of Dry Bones, in which God shows the prophet many dead bodies being returned to their living state and explains that Israel will be restored just so.   After the exile, many exilic biblical passages were reinterpreted as Israel's historical context changed, and in the face of oppression many Jews began to view Ezekiel's vision as a prophecy of a literal, bodily resurrection at the end of time, divine justice for the suffering they faced in life. We see this view in the book of 2 Maccabees (which FYI isn't considered canon by protestants) written in the second century BCE. The author recounts the oppression the Jews faced under the brutal Antiochus Epiphanes, who outlawed Jewish practices under pain of death. In the story, a mother and her seven sons bravely choose to be burned alive rather than renounce their faith, comforted by the knowledge that they will be resurrected to eternal life while Antiochus and his men rot in the ground.   A few centuries later we see a retelling of the same event in the book of 4 Maccabees, but this time the family is reassured not that they will be bodily resurrected, but that their souls will be immediately gathered to God, and that  >We, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with God, on whose account we suffer; but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire. (4 Mac 9:8-9)  For this author it is the soul that matters rather than the body, and since God is eternal, so is his judgment, immediate and everlasting. (The irony of the influence of Platonic philosophy on this author's account of a resistance against Greek culture is apparently lost on him.)   The persecution under Antiochus is the same situation that gave rise to apocalyptic literature like the book of Daniel (2nd century BCE), in which the author assures his reader that God will send \"one like a son of man\" to bring divine destruction onto the ruler and usher in the bodily resurrection and judgment immediately after his death (Daniel 11:45-12:2). The early Christians adapted this framework to Jesus. They believed he was Daniel's \"son of man\" who intervened to conquer death and sin and that his resurrection was the \"first fruits\" of the general resurrection soon to come (1 Corinthians 15:20).  Many believers changed their minds from belief in the resurrection to the belief in immediate spiritual judgment simply because God's physical intervention into history (known as the Kingdom Of God) and ushering in of the resurrection never came. We can see this even in the gospel of Luke, when Jesus tells the man being crucified next to him \"today you will be with me in Paradise.\" The evangelist even tells his readers not to expect the Kingdom Of God to come, but rather know that it resides inside them (Luke 17:21). Compare this to the other gospels in which Jesus assures his followers that the earthly Kingdom Of God is soon to come indeed (Matthew 24:30-34).  Plenty of Christians today believe in a synthesis of both immediate spiritual judgment and a bodily resurrection at the end of time. This belief goes back to the book of 4 Ezra, in which the eponymous Israelite leader is told by an angel that spiritual torment and paradise begin immediately after death, but that there is also a coming bodily resurrection, at which point the righteous will enjoy everlasting life and the wicked will finally be destroyed forever.

If natural does not mean biological, then what does it mean?  God given?  I bet your friend doesn't believe in God creating a list of acceptable behaviors that we all have to follow.  So then what do we mean by natural?  I am guessing what she means is that humans have created social systems that cause suffering for large numbers of people, and that that feels so wrong to her, that she wants to label it \"unnatural.\"  I completely understand that feeling and if I am honest I am also drawn to the idea that humans have created an \"unnatural\" world.  But if I take a step back and think like a social scientist, I realize that the term \"natural\" is just not defined in any way we can measure.  We have to stop looking at the past in order to prove that our way of thinking about the best kind of social organization is more objectively supported than someone else's.  That is terrible science.  The truth is that based on all the evidence we have from history and archaeology, humans are capable of creating unequal societies with high levels of suffering for oppressed groups.  We are also capable of creating unequal societies with low levels of suffering for oppressed groups, and more egalitarian societies where suffering is more or less equally shared.  There is no perfectly egalitarian society (gender and age have always shaped people's status and relationship to the group), but there are societies where everyone gets their basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and companionship met, and where everyone does useful labor and is seen as fully human.  But even in those more egalitarian societies people may be cast out and rejected if they are seen to be harmful enough to the group.  I would recommend the book The Dawn of Everything by Graeber and Wengrow to your friend.

Which reference frame do we use when we make such a powerful, general statement -- when we are using a framework (GR) where the idea of objective time doesn't make sense?  The answer lies in the fact that, although GR forbids us from choosing a universal reference frame as \"the truth\", it doesn't forbid us from using an *obvious* reference frame as a standard measure. When we say \"the universe is 13.77bn years old\" there is an unspoken addition to the end of the sentence which says \"in the standard cosmological reference frame.\"  So what is this standard reference frame, and why is it obvious?   One of the foundations of the theory of modern cosmology is the quasi-observed \"fact\"* that, above a certain lengthscale, the universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. That is, if you zoom out enough (looking at the scales of hundreds of  millions of lightyears), the universe appears to be made up of a uniform, *stationary* cosmological fluid. Our galaxies are simply perturbations in the density of this fluid.   It is this fluid with which we define our reference frame -- and we can measure how fast we are moving with respect to that frame by using the CMB dipole -- given that the CMB should be isotropic in the cosmological frame. We can see that we are moving at about ~600km/sec with respect to the CMB, and hence the cosmological reference frame.  Remember, there's nothing inherently *special* about this frame, it is merely the most convenient one for cosmologists to use as a basis for doing these kind of calculations.    *Why did I say quasi-observed?

As such, the theme of self-fragmentation and unity in God is really a common language of Christianity until later in the Protestant Reformation.  &#x200B;  Origen is a good place to start, and afterwards, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite,  both of whom are deeply indebted to the Neoplatonic tradition and to whom the Neoplatonic tradition is deeply indebted. I can't precisely speak to their views of eschatology, but as some of the founders of Neoplatanism, I'm sure there's something there.

Augustine takes up Plotinus as perhaps his first influence, and references to the *Enneads* appear everywhere in his texts (if you look up the Chadwick translation, he is very good at drawing out the Neoplatonic influences). Though of course he has much to say about the afterlife, he has far more to say about the movement into God/God's movement into the soul in *this* life.   &#x200B;  Dante is another that immediately comes to mind.

Anglicanism has a rich history of Neoplatonism from the Cambridge Platonists in the 17th century and again by the Oxford movement in the 19th, though of course this influence is falling away as Anglicanism increasingly embraces a more post-modern relation to scripture. The Neoplatannist tradition is certainly still alive in 'high Anglicanism' and often also in the so-called 'low Anglicanism' in smaller country parishes at least insofar as they still hold onto the BCP, which is fundamentally a Neoplatanist prayer book.

One of these is developed through actually *doing* things (think, muscle memory - like they say, you never forget how to ride a bike. Or, painting and drawing. The more you do it, the better you become at it). This is how children predominantly learn.  As we age, we start to develop that second type of memory which is based on just memorizing facts and connecting pieces of information. Great for the challenges of living in a 21st century where so many jobs require that kind of technical knowledge and experience. That's also how they tend to teach most subjects in school - you learn dates in history class, maybe some important factoids, and that's about it. Saaaame with language learning courses - they give you the grammar rules and some vocabulary and say \"OK put this into a sentence. Now repeat this phrase. Good job.\"   Well, that's just not a very effective way of learning language. But because we get so used to applying that style of learning to many things, and language would *seem* to lend itself more to that style of learning because it's just symbols and sounds, older people tend to ... just apply really ineffective methods to acquiring a new language.  Children are still relying on that mechanical muscle memory to process information, they're not worried so much about rules, they're more open minded.  edit: Also want to point out that this isn't a hard fast rule, as there are many adults who can pick up languages with relative ease.

Additionally breathing through your nose makes sure your air intake is regulated and you aren't prone to hyperventilating.  So that explains why breathing in through your nose while doing sports, meditation and... basically in every situation is the best way to breathe in, but why is breathing out through your mouth then advised in sports?  It's mostly about the speed of your oxygen intake. Or, to be more precise, about increasing the breathing frequency. As I just wrote the flow through your nose is rather limited. That works in both directions, if you breathe in as hard as you can and breathe out as hard as you can first through your nose then through your mouth you will see that you can breathe a lot faster through your mouth. So if you breathe out of your mouth you will save a little time which means that your intake frequency of oxygen will, overall, be higher.  TL:DR: Breathing in through your nose is easier on your lungs and more efficient, breathing out through your mouth has little drawbacks and is faster.

These two couples are going to use different homeschool programs, are going to have different standards of achievement for their children, are going to have different depths of understanding of the material even before you add in the normal educational variability of individual students.  Some parents homeschool literally just to be able to control their children’s exposure to outside influences completely.

I'm a stormwater engineer. I've literally spent all morning dealing with a similar scenario to this.   Every so often cities go through and update something called a plat. It's a city-wide document that goes over property boundaries and utility easement information. When something is marked as open space, sometimes also open utility space, U.E., utility corridor, etc, it means that the city has carte blanche to use that area for whatever improvements they want. Sometimes this comes as power lines, in your case it might end up being a box culvert with some pipes buried, who knows.   As far as I know, this isn't the same as public property. The project I'm dealing with now has an open utility area that we're working in that is owned by a housing association, for example. I would imagine the spot you're in is somewhat similar to that in so far as it's still your land, but the city could come in in a few years and say \"hey, we need to lay a pipe through your backyard\".   Now the interesting thing to me, is that these plats are usually somewhat historical documents. The ones I'm working off of were made close to 80 years ago, for example.  I find it somewhat weird that they're trying to convert to an open access land use. I would consult with an attorney that specializes in land dispute cases and see what they say about this. This could very well be a case of the city simply not knowing that this land is being utilized.   In the meantime, I would suggest against building on this plot. If it's converted to an open utility area and they need to lay a pipe down where your brand new deck is, you're SOL (also dealing with this right now for my project).  Edit: one last thing to add, the city might be dodgy about telling you what this means because the person you're talking to might legitimately not know.

If I had to sum things up, I would say \"religion and prophecy,\" but that also is not very interesting in and of itself.  **Joan as Holy Woman**  From Joan's own testimony at her trial, it is easily apparent that she was deeply immersed in the religious culture of her time. The saints most important to her are the most popular ones, she's right with the new trend in angels, she's sold on the rising importance of devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus.  This is important because Joan fits firmly in the context of the early 15th century as a holy woman and prophet. Her visions and auditions anchor her in a tradition going back to the mid-12th century of women who used the message that they spoke and acted based on direct revelation from God.   In Joan's time, *some* people are starting to question the validity of holy women's claims. The initial questions themselves, though in some ways the culmination of a longer trend, are highly political as a result of the Avignon papacy and (especially) the Great Schism (ca1378-1415). In other words, they are very much tied to ecclesiastical politics.  On the ground level, what we find is much more ongoing confidence in women's revelations. 14th century saints and visionaries Catherine of Siena and especially Birgitta of Sweden are *all the rage*. People even start attributing to Birgitta texts that she didn't write; she's that famous and popular even among the literate classes. Birgitta (and Pseudo-Birgitta) becomes especially well-known for two things that transcend the literacy barrier: prophecy and a set of prayers.  Not everyone, but a whole lot of people, took Joan absolutely seriously as conveying divine messages directly. In very particular, Charles VII was raised in an environment where his parents firmly believed in the prophetic powers of holy women. Charles VI had given audience to Jeanne-Marie de Maillé; and Isabeau, to Marie Robine (a peasant, by the way).   And this was, of course, the key issue at her initial and nullification (rehabilitation) trials: were Joan's fake or real; demonic or divine...according to the political beliefs of the judge or witness. For a demonstration, turn to no less a contemporary authority than French \"theologian &c\" Jean Gerson (uh...he was Really Important; roll with it), who is infamously on the record as opposing the legitimacy of holy women...but wrote dramatically in support of Joan.  **Joan and Wonders**  Kelly DeVries, who is basically *the* authority on Joan as a soldier and commander, stresses the importance of religion in the accounts of Joan's contemporary supporters as well as her own (*Joan of Arc: A Military Leader*, but especially \"A Woman as a Leader of Men\" in *Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc*, which is, well, about this question's precise topic). He's right, although his account is based on Joan's full career, including her victories. Which, again, is a liiiittle bit of a cop-out.  I want to go back to the 15th century mindset again, to look at the overall supernatural cosmology of the era. Well into the early modern era, there's no real divide between what we would call \"religion\" and \"magic.\" (Indeed, \"religion\" doesn't even have our meaning until the 15th century.) As with belief in revelations from God, people live in a world of wonders and miracles and saints and supernatural creatures. But as seen with growing concern with witchcraft and questions about holy women's sincerity, the boundaries are just starting to be sketched out by some people.  This is especially apparent in Joan's case. The wonders associated with her don't really have a division in what she relates about other people's support of her. They *do* have a divide in the mindset of her interrogators--and, because Joan is frakking *awesome*, she knows exactly what they're doing and keeps pace. (Seriously, read Dan Hobbins' translation *The Trial of Joan of Arc*. She's great.)  A big one is Joan's knowledge of and then the discovery of \"her sword\" in a church dedicated to one of France's most important saints. The finding of a blessed object has major precursors in the Middle Ages, especially associated with the Crusades. In the 15th century, that was more important than ever. The *physical reality* of objects was critical to how people saw the world and religion in a way it wasn't earlier. Second, the cult of relics and saints was, you guessed it, critical in a way it hadn't been earlier. (Think of Mark Twain's remark about there being more shards of the Holy Cross in the world--in the 19th century still!--than there could have been in the actual cross.)  According to Joan herself, people also told stories about a prophecy they associated with her and a tree/forest near her home in Domremy. But in her own words, what people said to her about this was just linked to her performing wonders. This probably included a miraculous power to heal, which was also heavily tied to holy women/living saints in late Middle Ages. (There are stories about men, women, and children all trying to touch Joan, which seems suspiciously, I don't know, *biblical*. And yes, at a time when there was much more preaching of the Bible directly.)   The tree was associated with fairies and local children performed May Crowning-type playing/ritual activities around it, although Joan insists she never believed any of it and never engaged in a lot of the behaviors her judges asked her about. Of course, they lie WILDLY when they write up the articles of condemnation. On one hand, they say Joan admitted to various things when she categorically had not. On the other, though, they exaggerate the various behaviors and beliefs they had asked her about earlier. And, unsurprisingly, they exaggerate according to particular patterns that align with the question of fake or real, demonic or divine.  So people associated Joan with the general performance of miracles and wonders.  **Hans Böhm**  Okay, obviously a man, obviously German, and not obviously a few decades after Joan. However, Böhm is a crucial parallel for a few reasons. Even venturing further into the very slowly increasing fear of witches, Böhm--a shepherd from Baden-Württemberg--essentially launched an entire revolt against unjust conditions based on his own prophecies and visions of Mary.  People were ready to heed prophecy that called to them--and did.  **Conclusion**  Joan was awesome; she promoted her awesomeness; she did so in a way that grew out of the religious culture in which she lived and believed."}, {"prefer": "For most recipes, if you want to replace sugar, you would need something granulated.

For example, it's commonly said that deep space has a temperature of about 2.7 K, but that's misleading. 2.7 K is the equilibrium temperature that an ideal blackbody would reach in deep space due to cosmic microwave background radiation.  So a better question would be, how close would you have to get to the sun for an ideal black body to be at room temperature? Spoiler alert: close to where the earth is. The answer is found by balancing incoming solar radiation with the outgoing blackbody radiation of the object, a common problem in introductory thermo classes. The derivation here, usually used to find the temperature of a hypothetical planet at a given distance, can be rearranged to solve for distance when given temperature, and the result is about 84 million miles, or 0.9 AU. This assumes the body is spherical, but an arbitrary shape would reach a similar temperature.  The difference between our hypothetical blackbody and the earth comes down to albedo (reflection), emissivity, and various greenhouse effects; if the earth were a perfect blackbody it would be about ~~40~~ 10 °C colder.  Edit: note, this only applies to something that isn't producing its own heat like a person or anything electronic. Any internal heat production means the body has to radiate more heat to reach equilibrium, resulting in a higher temperature.

In other words, how are we to know that matter hasn’t always existed, if even in a condensed form?  David Hume comes to mind. In his *Treatise of Human Nature*, he makes the observation that the Cosmological Argument for the necessary existence of God is built on the presupposition that X leads to Y, but that we only believe X causes Y because that’s all we’ve ever experienced. However, as Hume argues, we shouldn’t assume the notion that X leads to Y applies to all things—or that because there is matter, therefore there must have been a cause (God). Just because causal relationships between the existence of things is all that we have observed does not mean that we should assume this applies to matter itself, of which a cause has yet to be observed.  As Hume illustrates, just because every swan we see pass under the bridge is white does not mean the next swan we see pass under the bridge will also be white; just because all we have seen are white swans, does not mean that all swans are white.

The most plausible explanation is the hypothesis that a Mars-sized planet (which they named Theia) smacked us at a particular velocity/angle/location around 4 1/2B years ago--most likely twice, a few hundred thousand years apart.   The Wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact\\_hypothesis includes the technical links needed to explore this more deeply.

What's truly fascinating to speculate about is the possibility that we wouldn't be here if Theia hadn't paid that fateful visit back in the day. One study proposes that the volatiles needed to form life were produced by Theia's impact:  https://www.universetoday.com/141342/without-the-impact-that-formed-the-moon-we-might-not-have-life-on-earth/  And our remarkably large Moon (relative to Earth) formed by this impact stabilizes Earth on its polar axis. Otherwise Earth's axial wobble would be much greater.   And Theia's iron core merged with ours, giving us a stronger Van Allen belt, which prevents the surface of the Earth from being bombarded by anywhere near as much radiation as would be the case otherwise.   We don't know if the amped-up Van Allen Belt and the \"gift of the volatiles\" and the faster rotation and the Moon-induced larger tides contributed to making Earth more favorable to life beginning here, but it seems plausible.

At its heyday, the Mali reached the distant lands of some saharan cities (like Walata, Essouk/Tadmakka and Takedda) all the way to the Atlantic Coast, between the Senegal and Gambia rivers.     With that data in mind, we can proceed to investigate the watercourses the Malians would be familiar with and figure out the boats they used to navigate them. Namely, they were familiar with the slow waters of major rivers (Niger, Senegal and Gambia) and with the coast of modern day Senegambia. Sadly, we lack direct sources about what types of boats were available at that time (14th century) in that particular area (River valleys and Senegambian coast). However, we do have a lot of accounts from european traders from the 16th century onwards, and those are quite useful.     European traders, sailing along the Senegambian coast, quickly found africans (wolofs, serers, mandinkas, bizagos and others) using canoes - some quite large, that could transport cattle - to navigate the ocean. Those canoes lacked sails and depended on the strength of rowers to get somewhere. The fact that the Cape Verde islands (about 600 kilometers from the coast) were uninhabited prior to the arrival of european sailors is strong evidence that the local african canoes didn't get very far into the open sea, prefering coastal areas.     Those canoes were mostly made out a single tree and quite effective at their purpose (i.e. navigate around the coast and into river estuaries), but sometimes more diverse materials would be used.     In the larger and calmer rivers inland, canoes were used as well, but also bigger boats made out of several pieces of wood, capable of carrying lots of people and animals. They, however, also lacked proper sails and relied on people (either rowing or pushing against the riverbed with paddles) or simply the gentle currents of the river.     TL;DR: Basically canoes and boats that lacked sails and, despite their occasional large size, lacked the proper resistance to sustain damage caused by waves or fight sea currents. They wouldn't get far and, in the odd occasion that they did, the boats would be at the mercy of the ocean."}, {"prefer": "Flintknapping as a profession was still very active in the 19th century.

Natural selection can only work with the genes that are already present.  Let's say there's a shift to more salinity in a fresh water lake.  There are species A-D of fish in that lake.  All species are under the same selective pressure, Species A just don't have the genes to handle salt water and they go extinct (at least in that lake). Species B also just doesn't have any of the right genes but continue to exist in some shrunken sickly state. For Species C, 1 in 100 fish happened to have one copy of odd gene that helps with salinity.  The fish that have the gene flourish while those who don't die.  So species C survives just fine BUT the frequency of that special gene changes, now pretty much 99 out of 100 fish have at least one copy of it, and many have 2 copies.  Species D has a similar gene but most fish of that species already had it, because it gave them some other benefit as well (it allowed them to live in the shallow waters which froze solid), so they are living their lives just fine.  Now, due to both mild levels of solar radiation, and because our genes on rare occasions don't copy themselves perfectly new mutations happen.  But these are totally random, there is no guiding hand of nature that 'helps'.  So MAYBE species B eventually mutates and that mutation happens to be one that helps with salt water (which is as lucky as getting a winning lottery ticket - it's extremely rare)  But remember, it's random.  So, early humans were like that.  They spread from heavy sunlight with lots of chances to get vitamin D (fresh water) to areas with less sunlight in the winter (salty water)  EVERYBODY had a gene that made them slightly more dark with lots of sunlight and slightly less dark with less sunlight - but nobody had a gene than made skin significantly lighter.  But they were able to survive anyways.  Then by raw chance, two different mutations that gave lighter skin happened.  These genes gave an advantage, and so they spread quickly and pretty much everyone on the Eurasian Land mass had the gene.  Now in Africa and Australia it wasn't an advantage so it didn't really spread there.  But note, these genes popped up after people had been living in the northern regions of the UK, Germany, and various parts of Siberia for tens of thousands of years.  Then, by raw chance, a third mutation happened.  Having all 3 was slightly better than having just 2, so this new gene didn't spread all that much.  It stuck around Northern Europe.  Places in southern Europe and Southern Asia, to them having all 3 was actually worse than having just 2, so it didn't spread.  In theory, some of the people living in the arctic circle in Asia probably could have benefited, but either culturally they just so rarely met the peoples that had this new 3rd gene that it never became part of their genome, OR they had enough fish, liver, specialty plant, or other vitamin D sources that it didn't really matter if they had 2 lightening genes, or 3 lightening genes."}, {"prefer": "Nuclear capable aircraft are designed, equipped, and certified to deliver nuclear weapons.

Value in Marx has two forms. True value (ie. the value produced by the addition of labour to natural materials which is what gives you the famous reinterpretation of Ricardo's value theory) and value within the commodity system (given by the M-C-M (money - commodity - money)). To Marx the system of valuation within the commodity system, which could easily be subjective value, is a mask over the intrinsic value of a good such as it's value as natural capital and the human and machine labour required to turn it into a commodity. Most people miss the fact that Marx makes this differentiation from Ricardo. Within the commodity system commodities no longer have their true value. They have the value ascribed to them by the desire of capitalists to turn money into commodities and commodities into money. Today we would probably call the actualization of these desires advertising, branding and marketing.  He's basically arguing that if we want to know what something is really worth, we have to look at the material inputs and forces that are effected on nature in order to turn it into a commodity. Subjective value is all fine and good but commodities have a material reality that is independent of people. A loom is different than a horse even if there are no people to say that one is worth more than the other. It's important to remember that Marx is a materialist so for him economics has to be based on observable properties of the material world, so he's arguing against relativism and idealist conceptions of value.   Prices on the other hand are determined by the costs of materials and the costs of labour plus the natural rate of profit (or surplus value) that is determined by society. Basically he says prices are determined by input costs plus a profit margin which is basically how most firms determine their prices (with of course the obvious exception of cartels, de facto cartels, duopolies and monopolies)."}, {"prefer": "You're suggesting that mental illnesses are selected for . . . they're not, any more than are broken bones or coronary artery disease.  Human cognition is a remarkably complex apparatus, so complex that it remains poorly understood in many ways great and small. Far from being surprised that \"things can go wrong\"-- its remarkable that it goes right so much of the time. Human sociobiological evolutionary pressures don't protect us against pathology any more than than it protects against glaucoma. \"Its as good as it can be, considering\".  As just one example: most people can imagine things, but unless dreaming or in an altered state, do not hallucinate. That's a big deal. Very few people who are not profoundly mentally ill or in an altered state of consciousness, will hallucinate - though we all do while sleeping. So that's a pretty remarkable cognitive apparatus- one which is rigorously tuned enough to enable you to dream about your childhood pet in a way that seems very real, and yet to wake up and to understand that that pet has long since passed on to the great Dog Park in the sky. That's a remarkable level of cognitive organization, and its going to be typical of most adults; think of how complex it is.  We can broadly distinguish between two distinct categories -- incapacitating mental illness, which isn't useful in any circumstances, and is ordinarily quite rare- and the much more commonly encountered personality traits which may be appealing and useful in some contexts and not in others. \"Narcissism\" for example, is often a component of social and political charisma, as a matter of degrees it can be energizing and useful to a group; defining it as necessarily and monotonically pathological is overly reductionist. Similarly, there's a continuum between diligence and obsessive compulsive behaviors; you'd prefer a surgeon who was a \"neat freak\", that's not a bad thing, it's a good one. So a lot of negative personality traits are simply dialed up versions of something that at least in some circumstances both the individual and the group they belong to will find useful and/or appealing.  A final note is that the human cognitive capacity grew remarkably quickly -- and that happened on the neurological substrate of a skull and brain that was dramatically reshaped in a relatively short period.  Our brains and the cognitive apparatus in them aren't some clean sheet design; all sorts of quirks likely have their origins in evolutionary history.

Some fossils are actually completely preserved in such a way that you can take it apart layer by layer and \"disect\" an ancient animal. You can see the remnants of the food they ate, the size and shape of internal organs, etc etc and in doing so use logical reasoning to figure out how those adaptations would have been used.  Enviormental evidence helps too. A creature that builds a whole lot of nest in the same general area is most likely to be a group/pack/herd animal, for example. You also have the standard rules of evolution to help give you ideas as well. An animal that sticks out like a sore thumb or has an extreme adaptation is a clue that they specialize in some skill or trait because specializations are an evolutionary risk.

It's a very complicated issue, so I will try to cover all core information.  First of all, the modern people who call themselves Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, and Aramean all belong to the same ethnoreligious group, sometimes called \"Syriac-speaking Christians,\" since they speak dialects of Neo-Aramaic, a modern form of Syriac. What really differentiates them from each other is church denomination. Assyrians belong to the Assyrian Church of the East, also known as the \"Nestorian\" Church. This is the oldest church of the three that Syriac Christians belong to. Chaldeans belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church that split off from the original Church of the East in 1551CE. Arameans and Syriacs belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as the \"Jacobite\" Church. Yet, they are all the same people, and the most commonly accepted label is the Assyrian one.  The conflict between the people who identify and Assyrian and the people who identify as Aramean has severely divided this community. \"Arameans\" are almost always members of the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, \"Assyrians\" are found in all three churches, though, of course, they have the strongest presence in the Assyrian Church of the East. Modern Arameans believe that they descend from the ancient Arameans, a tribal people who likely originated from the Syrian desert in southern Syria. Modern Assyrians believe that they descend from the Neo-Assyrian Empire in northern Mesopotamia. This has caused an intense debate on the true origins and identity of the modern Assyrians. Personally, I have found the Assyrian side of the argument to be significantly better supported, via historical accounts, genetics, linguistics, and geographical location. However, there are scholars that support either side of the argument."}, {"prefer": "Go to see an osteopathic physician.

Blackjack has a memory unlike other games.  Big cards good, small cards bad.  5 year-olds shouldn't gamble anyways.   Source: former casino employee and card counter.  I'll start with some terms here:  House edge: expressed in a percentage.  The money the house expect to win on each bet.    Basic stragety: a tested theorem that that dictates a players move in a given blackjack hand. Please Google basic strategy,  there's a neat color coded chart you can look at.  Units: the number of increments of the minimum bet that the table maximum will allow.  For example, if you are on a $5 minimum BJ table with a limit of $250  that only allows you to play one hand you can bet 50 units.  House edge is a representation of the mathematical advantage that the house has built in its rules..  Here are some examples.   Roulette:  straight up bet pays 35 to 1.  I'd you win you get 35 plus your bet. There is 1 way to win, and on a double 0 wheel, 37 ways to lose. If you cover every number (stupid) you lose 38 and win 36.  So your return is 36/38.  That's 94.7% return  giving the house an edge of 5.3% Craps:  betting on a hop (one roll bet) pays to 30 for 1, 30 to 1, 15 for 1, or 15 to 1.  Deference here is academic in this case, most casinos only for one, but to one is better.  The 30s are for pairs (hard ways).  Let's say you think 11 will come next roll.  There are 2 ways to roll 11, 6-5, and 5-6, if you have problems seeing this, pretend the dice are different colors.  2 dice x 6 sides = 36 combos.   You have 2 ways to win out of 36.  Or, 1 in 18.  This bet at best pays 15 to 1.  So win 16, lose 18.  That's an 88.8% return giving the house an edge of 11.2%. SERIOUSLY, I KNOW HOP BETS SUCK.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOUSE EDGE.  Bet the pass line with 10x odds.  Happy?   The edge represents the difference between the true odds vs payable odds.  With me so far?    Here's where things change. In all other games of \"chance\", these odds never change.  Two dice always roll 11 with the same 2/36 chance, number 21 comes up approximately 1 out of 38 times in roulette. This is inescapable.  Short term variance is expected and even necessary,  no one would play a game where they always lost.  But blackjack and it's variants (of the non continuous shuffle variety) are different fundamentally, they have memory.  There a finite number of cards in that games universe if you will.  In a 6 deck shoe (suits don't matter in BJ) there are 312 cards. 24 of each A-9, and 96 10 value cards (10, J, Q, K no difference between these functionally) Basic strategy is a statistical model that, based on the  rules of the casino at which you are playing, help you make the least bad decision.  I say least bad, because it is accurate.  There are no good decisions in blackjack because statistically it is still a negative expectation game.  Meaning, over a large sampling, with perfect basic strategy, you will still lose.  Now, this is for everyone in the back, STATISTICAL OUTCOMES HAVE NOTING TO FUCKING DO WITH SHORT TERM SUCCESS OR FAILURE!!!!!!  So, a recap here.  Most games suck because the odds are bad and built in.  You can chose less bad bets, but all bets are bad, get it?  But wait,  you said Black Jack is different!  It is.  As I said,  basic strategy lets you make the least bad decisions.  Some situations actually have a positive expected outcome, like doubling down when you have 11 vs a dealers up card of 6.  Keep in mind though, that the aggregate of all those situations still places you in the territory of negative expectation.    Card counting:  there are plenty of tutorials online to teach this, but as a very simple rule of thumb, because of the rules of hitting and staying that casinos follow for their dealers, big cards favor the player, while little cards favor the dealer.  I'm not going to get into the math here, it's rather lengthy, but suffice to say that knowing the ratio of big cards to little cards remaining in the deck can offer an advantage to the player.    So, why does the dealer have the advantage on black jack?  It's not their hit/stand rules.  Those only exist because if they were any more lenient to the dealer no one would play.  THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THE HOUSE HAS IN BJ IS THE DOUBLE BUST LOSS. Scenario 1.  Player has 20, dealer busts.  Player wins Scenario 2.  Player has 20, dealer has 20.  Player pushes (ties) nobody loses/wins Scenario 3.  Player busts his hand, dealer has 20.  Dealer wins.  These all seem fair so far.  Here's the one that earns all the house it's money. Scenario 4.  Player busts his hand.  Dealer busts his hand.  Player still loses.  That's it.  They only advantage.  So, try not to take hits that can bust you unless you statistically need to.  Let's now regroup.   1.  You know that busting loses your money, though paradoxically, standing when you should hit, while reducing your bust %, actually lowers your statical overall win % more. 2.  You know that because 10s are good for you and little cards are bad, if you can keep track of the ratio of that and are in the right situation, you can have an advantage over the house.  The average difference in expressed advantage generally is only 2%.  Let's say the house has a 51-49 advantage over you, sometimes you can make that 51-49 in your favor with counting.  How do you take advantage of this?  Unit betting.   Let's take a $5 dollar table. It has 7 spots.  You are the only player.  It's max is$ 500. This casino let's you play all 7 spots if the table is empty.  Therefore, the unit spread is as follows 500/5 = 100 units per spot *7 spots = 700 unit spread.  (This is an example only, doing this will get you labeled as a counter on the spot and backed off immediately) As you know the deck (shoe) favors the dealer most of the time it makes sense to expose the least amount of your money to that negative expectation.  When the 10 ratio changes in your favor, you can now expose 700 times that bet to a positive outcome.   So while you're only going to have a %2 advantage, you're now betting 3500 with a better than even chance of winning.  (YES I KNOW THINGS GET STREAKY SOMETIMES.  SHUT UP, THESE ARE BASICS. GO FIND SOME COUNTING SUB REDDIT)  So, get it?  Expose less of you money when you're at a disadvantage and more when it's in your favor.  Counting is the exact reverse of the casino model.  You're eking out wins on a small marking, but unlike the casini, you can alter your betting and actions with this knowledge   TL;DR. yes, blackjack is the a beatable game, but only if you're a card counter.   P.s. baccarat.  Yes, it is a coin flip.  And yes, I've heard of a way to count it.  Here the only situation I know of where it can be counted.  At the beginning of the shoe, the dealer reveals the first card and burns that many cards.  If you can keep track of the 10s in the shoe, and this count of remaining 10 in the deck is equal to burn cards plus the remaining cards in the deck after the cut card is pulled out, theoretically you could guarantee a tie bet, but I'd be willing that this is sore rare in practice, you're better off just studying something useful and getting a career change or a promotion.

Because the association between Cheerios and manhood is so widespread, people will also assume the opposite: if you *don't* eat Cheerios, you are not a real man.

But when an overwhelming portion of a modern society feels a certain way, that feeling / belief system becomes part of society, and creates exclusion of people who do not feel that same way. It becomes a truth in society.  A woman who thinks this way is implicitly saying that her gender (\"I feel like a woman\") is directly tied to her biological sex (\"I have a vagina / female sex organs\"), which is objectively trans-exclusive, *especially* because that usually means \"If I didn't have a vagina, I would feel like less of a woman,\" and *especially* when it is the majority view.

To simplify it we will use a substitution cipher. The most basic of all ciphers/encryption.   The “A” key will increment each letter by +1. So D -> E, E -> F, and so on. The “B” key will increment by -1, so P -> O.

The keys generated are complex enough to avoid collision, or when someone else’s key pair might accurately decrypt your message.  Ok, now that we have our keys, we always keep one secret and only known to us, the private key. Use encode the message we want to send using our Private key(A).

I use my Private A key, decrypt their B key they sent, and use that to decrypt their message “LOL”.  Now that we have exchanged keys, and have a secure method to exchange messages, anytime I want to send my friend a message, I encrypt it with their Public B key, which ensures only they can decrypt it with their private A key. The problem is asymmetrical encryption like this is slow. Using the secure exchange we setup we mutually agree to start using a symmetrical encryption method and generate a key to use (Key C).

Light is a form of energy, but when you turn the light off, the light goes away, so where does the energy go?  The short answer is: it gets absorbed by the wall as heat.  The longer answer needs a bit of a more detailed mental picture. The wall is a solid, which consists of a (fairly) regular structure of atoms. Just imagine a grid of hard spheres laying against each other. This is the surface of the wall. At absolute zero, these atoms do not move and are simply at rest, one just touching the next. Having a temperature means that the wall contains ~~heat~~ *thermal energy*. This ~~heat~~ *thermal energy* is a random motion of the atoms around their equilibrium point, they're basically vibrating. Such a vibration can travel rather far through the lattice in the form of a wave. One ball pushes the next, which pushes the next, which pushes ... etc. Such a wave is commonly called a 'phonon', because it is also the way in which sound can move through solids.  Now think of the light. Light consists of tiny particles called photons, not to be confused with the phonons in the wall. Each photon is a tiny packet of electromagnetic energy and momentum. If such a photon hits (an atom of) the wall, its energy and momentum is absorbed. Since both these quantities need to be conserved, it means the atom will get a little \"kick\" from absorbing the photon. It will move, and kick against its neighbor, etc etc. So basically the photon has been converted into a phonon.  If enough photons get absorbed, this will result in the wall warming up slightly. So the light gets converted into ~~heat~~ *thermal energy* in the wall.  It's rather analogous to a stone falling into a lake. The energy of the stone will spread out over the surface of the water in the form of waves. The water itself doesn't move much, but the waves can carry the energy quite far. Likewise, the atoms don't move much, but the energy/momentum from the photons can carry rather deep into the wall."}, {"prefer": "when interviewing, the best tip a professor told me was that you are on interview the entire time.

In a sense, a built-in instinct to be extremely gullible is an evolutionary advantage for a child.  Being gullible means you learn faster because you don't try to filter any of what you're being taught through skeptical analysis.   But it comes with the downside that you learn *everything* you're being told, both true and false.  How big a downside that is varies depending on the ratio of true information to false information that you are being taught.  For a naive child who knows very little about the world, being taught by the child's parents and grandparents, there's so much new good knowledge to soak in that it's worth it to speed the process up even if that means it comes with the occasional bad knowledge.  The kid is drinking from a firehose of information and has to take in as much as possible as fast as possible.  But as the kid grows up and becomes an adult, a distrust of new information grows.  This is because as they catch up to the knowledge of the tribal elders and become just as schooled as everyone else, the ratio of good new information to bad new information changes.   Now if the information is truly new, and *especially* if it requires having to un-learn previous information because the new information contradicts the old, the probability that this is because the new information is wrong is much higher than it was when you were a child.  Now the same gullibility that served you well as a child is a detriment as an adult.  So it's not surprising that adults are more \"set in their ways\".  It's how our instincts have taught us to be.  Because it was actually a good idea once upon a time.  But in modern times, the rate of new information being learned each decade is much higher than it was for our ancestors.  When technology and society moved slowly, information you learned as a child was still good information 50 years later.  With the rate of change these days this is less true than it once was.  But instincts drilled into our DNA don't change as fast as our society does.  We may work in office buildings typing onto computers, but our brains are still optimized for the life of a hunter-gatherer wandering the grasslands.  Finding the right point between the disadvantage of gullibility (believing everything new) and the disadvantage of rigidity (believing nothing new), is a delicate balance.  You can apply the open-minded but still skeptical reasoning of empirical analysis, but this is actually NOT something we're as good at as we like to think we are.

But in real life, in situation 1 there can be a quite significant difference. That's because the refrigerator's cooling system, the heat pump, cycles on and off controlled by a thermostat.  When there's more thermal mass inside, it will cycle on and off more slowly.  In an idealized model, that wouldn't matter. If it ran 25% of the time, it wouldn't matter whether that was 1 hour out of four hours or one minute out of 4 minutes.  But the actual vapor compression refrigeration cycle relies on maintaining a pressure difference between the condenser and the evaporator.  Each time it turns on, the compressor needs to first build up that pressure difference before much of work the compressor is doing goes into refrigeration.  Then when it turns off, the pressures equalize between the condenser and evaporator, losing the work that was done to build up that pressure difference.  So there's a certain amount of energy wasted for each cycle, and the slower cycling fridge with the higher thermal mass uses less energy over the course of a day.  Note that better refrigerators will have smart* controls that will avoid having it cycle too fast even if there's very little inside.  But in order to prevent the short cycling, they have to allow the temperature inside to swing up and down more than it would if they allowed the fast cycling, and more than it would if the fridge was full.  Having the temperature cycle up and down a lot is worse for keeping food fresh, so even in that case, having more thermal mass inside is beneficial even if its effect on energy savings is reduced.  *By smart I mean a really basic level of well-designed controls, not being connected to the internet or having a color touch panel on the front or anything like that."}, {"prefer": "DON'T PUT IT ON YOUR RESUME!

We read their literature, as well as we know how, and so far as it still exists. We excavate their cities and sanctuaries, and interpret them as carefully as we can. And then we try to shore the literary fragments against the ruins, and extrapolate a world. Can we know what individuals thought? Unless they were kind enough to write it down for us (and their jottings survived), no. But to the extent that the literature and the archaeological remains seem to agree, and to the extent that our cross-cultural models allow us to understand them, we can usually form a picture, however hazy, of practice and belief in an ancient society.   As devoted readers of this sub, you know all this already. I just felt like pontificating. For a little more substance, let's turn, all too briefly, to the Greeks and Romans.   Two blanket statements. First, virtually all Greeks and Romans believed in their gods. Second, belief in the gods did not necessarily translate to a literal understanding of the traditional myths about those gods.   Greek religion and Roman religion - to use conventional shorthands for what were actually loose families of affiliated but distinctive local practices - were focused on practice, rather than belief. The gods, in other words, were assumed to be much more interested in what their worshipers did for them than in what their worshipers thought them. This meant, in effect, that the act of sacrifice was the ultimate statement of belief: gratifying the gods with burnt offerings (or libations, etc.) was at once a prudent insurance policy and an effective profession of faith. It might be tempting to imagine (by analogy with modern religious holidays) that traditional religious festivals in the classical world eventually became more or less formalities - a chance for everybody to kick back, watch a little drama, and enjoy a bit of barbecued ox. For some Greeks and Romans, they may well have become so. But the mere fact that sacrifices continued regularly, century after century, in so many ancient cities suggests that the great majority took them quite seriously: the gods were real, and had to be placated. To this can be added the vast body of evidence for personal devotion to the gods - family altars, ex voto offerings, dedications at shrines, etc., etc. And to that we may add the testimonials provided by our  literary sources, which establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the great majority of Greeks and Romans assumed that the gods were very real.   None of this means, of course, that they took the myths seriously. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers and public intellectuals began to criticize the myths. Some of the more radical thinkers of the Classical period theorized that the myths were actually dimly-remembered episodes from ancient history, and that the gods had originally been human kings and inventors. Others speculated that the gods and the myths had been deliberately invented in the distant past as a means of political control. Similar strands of criticism are visible in Stoic philosophy (which treated the myths as allegories), in Epicurean philosophy (which treated the myths as dangerous fables), and in the general intellectual milieu of the Roman imperial era (see, for example, the splendid satires of Lucian). It seems clear that most educated Greeks and Romans really did regard the myths as a matter of cultural literacy, not literal truth. But their disdain for the myths was motivated largely by a desire to disassociate them from the gods, in whom most of them still believed. The myths, it was thought, were unworthy of the gods, and the gods undeserving of the myths foisted upon them by tradition.   I could cite various passages from ancient authors in support of all this; but frankly, I'm tired. The point, in any case, needs no belaboring. In certain contexts, many Greeks and Romans were perfectly comfortable mocking the gods of myth - take Dionysus in Aristophanes' Frogs, or Zeus in any of Lucian's dialogues. There were even \"theme parks\" of a sort, in the case of Ilium, a major tourist destination on what was thought to be the site of Homer's Troy (more on such tourism here). But for most Greeks and Romans (with the exception of those wretched atheistic Epicureans), the gods were real. Take the emperor Julian's heartfelt (if tedious) hymn to Cybele, or Apuleius' paean to Isis, or Aelius Aristides' praises of Ascelpius, or even - at the beginning of classical literature - Odysseus' relationship with Athena. The Greeks and Romans didn't always take their gods seriously.

This argument will stand or fall depending on how plausible whatever the defining quality being posited is. For instance, rational capacity seems overly restrictive, since it cuts out infants and the very old from moral consideration (can we eat them?) A more plausible option, the ability to suffer, seems like it includes animals (unless we adopt some very weird Cartesian view on which animals are just automata). So picking a quality here is going to be tricky.  Other possible reasons: nothing is morally impermissible since there are no moral facts, moral permissibility is determined by cultural convention which favours meat-eating, eating animals is somehow in their best interest (because we breed lots of them which we'd stop doing if we didn't eat them).

If there's a version that says all you have to do is start a co-op and everything will be utopian glory, so therefore we should force everyone into co-ops (and I wouldn't be surprised if there is), then yes, it's nonsense that's trivially refuted.    But utopian theories tend to be less readily falsifiable.  From what I've heard of them, anarchists don't seem to be clear on what would replace coercive authority.  But something would.  Maybe it's pure woo, but they have some sort of verbiage there.  Maybe the difference is that we wouldn't have to tax ourselves to support the coercive apparatus of the state: then you would have to compare tax-exempt adequately-capitalized co-ops (where the workers are all exempt from income tax too, not just the firm itself) with tax-paying privately-owned businesses, in order to refute it.  Maybe they believe that businesses are very dependent on reputation, and that being a co-op brings an air of leftist radicalism.

Because his name was Shazamo (pfffft AHAHAHA), he decided to choose immortal heroes whose names spelled out his own.   However, the O immortal, Oggar, wound up turning evil, so Shazamo cast him out, erased knowledge of him from existence, and even changed his own name to Shazam in defiance.  In time he realized he could do even more good if he granted all the heroes' powers to one singular Champion. By this time he'd *apparently* traded out his original batch for other immortals from a more recent civilization (Egypt). So he created Black Adam (this ended badly too. The Wizard is basically second only to the Guardians of Oa for screwing things up a long time ago).   Eventually, after the shame of creating Black Adam wore off, the Wizard chose another six immortals (Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury) and waited for a worthy champion to receive their powers. That was Billy. Later on he gave Billy's sister Mary a whole other suite of powers from another batch of immortals: Selene, Hippolyta, Ariadne, Zephyr, Aurora, and Minerva.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not go harassing some of the scholars I talk about, despite their terrible takes. These are issues to be dealt with in journal articles and NOT random internet strangers harassing people. As far as I am concerned the matters discussed have been addressed.\r   \r   **Second, I want to provide some context on my academic background:**  \r   I have a master's degree in music composition, and strong subject-matter experience in Musicology. My main area of interest is in American composer Lou Harrison, parts of whose life and works I am considered an expert on. I also have dabbled in discussing the relationship between late 19th/early 20th century French music and Orientalism, which happens to have a fair amount of crossover with Harrison criticism.  \r   Philosophically, I am interested in action, ethics, pedagogy, and emotions. I am a huge Martha Nussbaum fan. out of every scholar/author I have read she has probably had the largest impact on my writing and approach to academics.\r   \r   Anyways, on to the story of how I fell into a research topic, and how the crazy stuff I found changed my thesis.\r   \r   The topic I am currently involved in is discussing the ethics of cultural appropriation in the context of music scholarship. Most recently I wrote and presented at a conference, a very brief version of a 75 page paper on the subject matter (this was in 2021).\r   In Lou Harrison scholarship there are two extreme camps (I'm exaggerating their positions here for the sake of clarity, I don't have time for lit review), with some people being a little more subtle than others:  \r   1) Lou Harrison could do nothing wrong, his music is not cultural appropriation. How do you even suggest this?  \r   2) Lou Harrison is a hardcore Orientalist and a Musical Colonist.  \r   To make matters worse, most of the scholars on the subject had some sort of personal relationship with Harrison, or are white gamelan musicians/composers with serious stakes as they pertain to the question: \"Was Lou Harrison an appropriator?\" It is really REALLY difficult to find any scholarship on the topic that is not serving some sort of personal agenda.\r   Generally speaking, the people in camp #2 don't really address any of the concerns of the people in camp #1, since the folks in camp #1 knew Harrison to be a very nice guy with strong moral convictions. Camp #1 believes camp #2 is very unfair to Harrison. Camp #2 tends to found its critiques of Harrison on post-colonial scholarship, which camp #1 believes denies the historical fact that Harrison was a good person with good intentions who studied gamelan directly.\r   \r   The people in camp #1 tend to have been friends with Harrison in life, or have personal stakes in writing for Javanese Gamelan ensemble, so are obviously going to take issue with camp #2. Camp #1 also has some pretty bad arguments as to explain what Harrison did was not appropriation/isn't problematic in some way.\r   \r   The first line that really drove me batty is from a popular and recent (and actually quite good) Harrison biography:  >\r   \"to paint Harrison as a cultural colonialist and “appropriator” of artistic resources is a naive moral judgement...As a gay man, \\[sic\\] sympathized with victims of bigotry, including those subjected to colonialism\"  \r   \rThis line bothered me when I first encountered it, but I was still trying to explain away Harrison's cultural appropriation. Tackling the problem from an ethics perspective hadn't quite occurred to me yet. It goes without saying that the argument is a weak ethical argument, and a frustrating blemish on a really good book.\r   \r   It was not until I encountered an article entitled “Issues of Pastiche and Illusions of Authenticity in Gamelan-Inspired Composition” by an English(?) gamelan scholar that I ended up with my paper topic. \r   \r   **Short Summary of the article**\r   \r   The author of this article is interested in what may constitute “authentic” Javanese music, and an authentic expression of “bi-musicality.” Bi-musicality means a way of operating in and between two distinct musical traditions as to create a hybrid sort of music. I’ll get back to what reasons Sorrell had for arguing this when I talk about why I LOATHE this article in a bit.\r   \r   Sorrell argues for the existence of a sort of “bi-musicality” and critiques Harrison’s music as  appropriative, with his main issue being “cultural projection.” Harrison’s use of just-intonation in his writing for gamelan ensemble is an example of projecting the composer’s western ideology onto gamelan, which is compounded by, “Harrison’s appropriation of Javanese terminology, as it carries specific expectations and suggests a more genuinely Javanese product than in fact exists.” (Sorrell, 41) \r   \r   Up to this point, Sorrell’s article isn’t problematic. I think he actually had some very good points, but then he goes on and admits to lying about his name and race in a public concert to prove a point about perceived authenticity and why his own music is bi-musical (and therefore not appropriative).\r   \r  >“In order to deflect unwelcome focus on myself as the composer \\[of Missa Gongso\\], but even more to convey an illusion of authenticity to enhance the reception of the work, I adopted a pseudonym. In fact I invented a totally fictitious 20th-century Italian-Javanese composer (even more bi-musical than I could hope to be) by the fanciful name of Napoleon Sutono (abbreviated to ‘Napotono’), whose musical loves were gamelan, European polyphony and, above all, J.S. Bach.” (Sorrell, 44)\r   \r  This passage made me so angry, and it was upon reading I knew I absolutely needed to crush this man (academically, of course. From what I hear he is actually quite nice). It was also in this passage where I realized that the main avenue of inquiry I should be exploring was NOT whether or not the music was appropriative, but rather the ethics of writing appropriative music. What makes appropriation unethical?\r   \r   The strategy of many of the articles I had read was to make ontological claims about what was/wasn’t appropriation, and then to show that something was/wasn’t ethical based on whether or not it was appropriation (Sorrell the biggest offender). \r   \r   This methodology is flawed, so I went diving for writings on the ethics of knowledge and appropriation and wound up finding Miranda Fricker’s *Epistemic Injustice*.\r   \r   Eventually I revised my thesis. I moved away from defending Harrison on ethical grounds, and instead argued that his defenders need to be more reflective of the epistemic harms of their practices. My issue was not with musical content, but with the social context in which appropriative works are performed."}, {"prefer": "Racial categories, as we talk about them in the general public, are defined by the way people look.

Here's a quote from a 2018 review paper talking about coronaviruses in general, before the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered: \"As described so far, coronaviruses are respiratory viruses that exhibit neurotropic capacities that not only allows them to achieve latency and avoid the immune response of the host, but also have neurological implications that can complicate the disease associated to its infection.\"  In other words, even in 2018, it was known that coronaviruses can affect the brain. With that said, the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, not coronaviruses. It's very rare for rhinovirus infections to directly involve the brain (source, source). Still, rhinovirus infection can indirectly affect the brain by inducing cytokine release that causes things like fever and sickness behavior. Sometimes fevers from the common cold can even lead to seizures, but this is relatively rare and usually only happens in young children (source, source). The common cold does not usually cause high fevers in adults (source), but again can still indirectly affect the brain by causing low mood, fatigue, brain fog, etc. (source).  Unlike the common cold, COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly affect the brain in multiple ways (source, source, source).

That water is then pumped outside and poured over big fiber boards while a fan blows outside air past them. This evaporates some of the water, and the remainder is cooled by the evaporation. The remaining cooled water is pumped back inside the datacenter and the process repeats. 2. The datacenter uses industrial air conditioning units called CRACs, which have radiators outside the datacenter. The air conditioner compresses a gas, heating it up, and then pumps it through the radiator while a fan blows outside air across the radiators. Once the compressed gas is cooled, it is brought back into the datacenter and allowed to expand, which makes it cold. Air inside the datacenter is blown over a different radiator filled with this cold gas, cooling the datacenter air. On very hot days, the CRAC sprays the outside radiators with water, which evaporates on the radiator and cools it more than the air alone would. 3. The datacenter brings in outside air directly to keep the inside air cool. On hot days, the datacenter's systems will spray a mist of water into the air on its way in. That mist evaporates quickly and cools the outside air further before it reaches the datacenter floor."}, {"prefer": "Clearly they are using the subconscious to observe inconsistencies.

A strong case can be made that you act in a morally objectionable way when you take unnecessary risks which may or may not actually cause real suffering. This moral wrongdoing would likely be amplified the more trivial the reason for taking said risk. An example of this idea that I find persuasive is imagining a pilot who, because he is running a few minutes behind schedule, neglects to have the proper safety inspections done in his plane. By doing this, he's able to get on route at the time scheduled so he doesn't face any repercussions for his tardiness (Whether this relates to how pilots really work is something I have no clue of. This example, as it was explained to me, is just about the principle). Now, say we discover that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the plane. All the equipment is stacked appropriately, the oxygen masks come down correctly, ect. Did the pilot do something wrong? I think so. The potential negative consequences were high enough and the benefit low enough that it seems to me that he has made a morally objectionable risk. It could turn out that bees are simply incapable of suffering, in which case our current practices (absent ecological concerns) are acceptable, but it's at least plausible that they do.

We in fact have people of the time tell us this: the Tokugawa, through marriage alliances, were able to grab enough allies to win control of Japan in 1600. So they included in their first set of laws issued in 1615 to all other daimyōs that there would be no marriages between warrior families without the Shōgun's approval (the Tokugawa themselves violated the same edict left in Hideyoshi's will). And in case someone important thought it didn't apply to them, in 1635 the law was clarified to include not only daimyōs but their immediate retainers and division heads. They were that scared marriage alliances would form power blocks to make a mess of things.  I would also like to add some things not mentioned in their great answers to the question linked above: the marriage also acted as a fantastic insurance policy.  First, if the alliance really were going to be broken, likely family correspondences would offer the earliest warnings. A famous, albeit apocryphal, story has Nobunaga's sister Oichi warning him his brother-in-law had betrayed him by sending Nobunaga a sack of beans tied up on both sides. While apocryphal, it's not improbable that Oichi did send Nobunaga some sort of warning. Even if not, we have another example Takeda Shingen's daughter-in-law was from the Imagawa clan. When Shingen decided he would backstab the Imagawa, his son supposedly plotted to assassinate him. Shingen had forced his son to divorce his daughter-in-law, strip his son of the position as heir to the clan, and execute a few ranking vassals. The poor young man was placed under house arrest for two years in a temple where he died. So while in this case the marriage alliance was not successful, consider the length to which the son was willing to defy his father to try to hold it together tells us the marriage definitely strengthened ties. Having no doubt heard about the entire thing and the death of his brother-in-law, the Imagawa daimyō requested Shingen send him back his sister, which Shingen complied. Only over a year later did Shingen invade the Imagawa. So the entire ordeal gave the Imagawa at least three years of warning. They still lost but it's not the marriage's fault.  Second, *even if* things do come to war with one side getting beat, your family/in-laws would likely offer mercy or beg for mercy on your behalf. In his rise to power in central Asia, Timor pardoned most Amirs whom he had a marriage alliance with but later came to blows. Likewise, in my area to use one of countless examples, the Hōjō clan went up against Hideyoshi and lost Hideyoshi basically ordered the clan's complete destruction, but the life of the final Hōjō daimyō Ujinao was spared because he was the son-in-law of Tokugawa Ieyasu as the Hōjō and the Tokugawa had a marriage alliance and Ieyasu begged for Ujinao's life to Hideyoshi. Ujinao's punishment was decreased to taking his buddhist vows to become a monk, and within a few years he was pardoned and became a daimyō again (albeit with a tiny fief).  Third, marriages themselves were insurance policies through the ties they create. In 1600 when the Mōri/Ishida side were going to war with the Tokugawa, the Sanada were caught in the middle because they had marriage alliances with both sides. What the Sanada did was decide to \"split\" in two, have a mock fight among themselves, and when the dust settled between the others the half that sided with the winners begged for mercy on behalf of the half that sided with the losers. In this case it was successful, but even if it wasn't at least half the family would have survived with their political powers intact (the winning half was given the realm of the loosing half, so no net change). And to be sure the Sanada weren't the only one to pull this trick.  Finally, even if all else fails, and the family is completely destroyed by the alliance breaking, hopefully the blood will live on through the son/daughter's offspring.  Note this is just about the strength of the alliance itself, and nothing about the familial ties and inheritance opportunities marriages create.  Also saying a substantial portion of marriages were loveless is likely a false modern bias. There are plenty of loveless marriages today and I see no proof there were proportionally more in history. Even if true, we have *plenty* of accounts and evidence of loving marriages."}, {"prefer": "Some people, usually older people, but much more rarely thin young people, develop bradycardia and pass out with even light pressure to the carotid sinus.

The property of primes you have to know is that every single number has only one so called \"prime factorization\" which just means that if you only multiply prime numbers, there is only one combination of those prime numbers that gives you your original number.  Example 1: 17*47=499. The only way you can get 499 from prime numbers is by multiplying 17 and 47.   Example 2: 2\\*2\\*2\\*19=152 is the only way to multiply prime numbers and get 152.  Etc. You can do that for every number.  The trick is that while it's \"easy\" to multiply numbers together, it's incredibly hard to reverse it. Like, try to find the prime factorization of 2455. (Actually don't try, it's not going to work, it's 5*491)  You basically have to go through every prime number one by one, and multiply them to find out what it might be.  So you have an operation that's easy in one direction and hard to reverse.   You have, a basic encryption algorithm.

It's worth watching the full 16 minute video, but the answer is that the grid would need about 25% more capacity if every single person in the US switched to electric vehicles. And the grid operators can easily increase the capacity by 25%. The electric grid from 1960-2000 increased capacity by 4% per year, so it would only take about 7 years to fully increase the grid.  As for why it can get overwhelmed by AC during heat waves, that is a business choice not a physics choice. The grid could be designed to handle any demand from all the AC. But that only happens a few days a year and not even guaranteed every year. That peak capacity is wasted most of the time. This is especially true because thst demand is only for a few hours a day even on the worst days. A peak demand like that is the hardest and most expensive way to produce electricity.

What they do have is high volume and pressure to perform. My biggest concern with hiring someone with no experience is not the actual baking (that's as skill that can be taught to the majority of people) - it's getting someone with either no work ethic or simply no idea that yes, this means up at 3am. Yes, this means on your feet for 8-12 hours a day. No, you can't take a lunch now because the oven is full and your bread needs you.   It's the same idea behind starting as a dishwasher in a restaurant. Surviving a Saturday night dish shift doesn't mean you can cook, it means you can do the physical work. Surviving Thanksgiving in a grocery store means you won't break if you come in to a dozen wedding cakes.  You can take classes if you want. Generally experience is rated higher than education *but* baking is a little different because there are usually fewer bakers on staff - as little as one and a backup. That means less time and money to pay for an apprentice. If you have a community college near you, check for baking classes. Those will be more affordable and fill you in on basics and familiarize you with the equipment you'll be using.

For example, adding two numbers.  These instructions are coded in binary. For example, the instruction to add two numbers in memory (along with an optional constant) might look like:  0010000XXXXXYYYYYZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ  Where the X's represent the location to find the first number. the Y's represent the location to find the second number, the Z's represent the third constant, and the 0010000 is what tells the computer that this is an adding operation.  This is not a particularly intuitive representation. So instead we might want to represent it with something more like language, like:  \"ADD X Y Z\"  But now we need a program that converts \"ADD X Y Z\", which we understand, into \"0010000XXXXXYYYYYZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\", which the computer understands. So we make a program that does that, directly programming it with machine code.  This is how *assemblers* came into being. This slightly-higher-level language was called Assembly and the programs that would convert assembly into machine code were assemblers.  Higher level languages make the commands even more sensible and memorable, translate into multiple machine-level instructions with a single high-level command, and also optimize and streamline code.  The first high level languages would have been programmed in assembly, along with the programs to convert the high level language into machine language, called *compilers.*  Today, we use high level languages to make *other* high level languages."}, {"prefer": "I think the assumption in the question is wrong.

Bane-line Sith like Plagueis and Tenebrous spent a good chunk of their time hunting down and destroying these “pretenders”  For those that never joined a dark side religion (Sith, Nightsisters etc.), and escaped the Jedi infant screenings for whatever reason, many of them did typical low level sociopath type things - they went into organised crime, politics, gambling, business, finance etc. a rare few went into archaeology/history/academia to study the Sith, Jedi and other force traditions. A large number of them became crazed murder hobos.   Despite their enhanced abilities, they had a tendency to live fast and die young, meeting the wrong end of a blaster or vibro blade after pushing their supernatural luck too far. The Dark Side is strong, but not that strong - running face first into a Jabba or a Boba Fett would mean a swift death if they were lucky, and a slow lingering one if they were not  As for the scenario you outlined, the “smart” thing to do is to shoot the Jedi Temple a Holonet email or something explaining your situation. They won’t make you a Jedi or anything, but they probably have some meditation techniques or pamphlets or light side self help books or whatever that will help with the murderous urges and bouts of megalomania. And they’d likely pay you well for any info and artefacts you had on the Sith - the archivists would love to add a couple Sith lightsabers/blasters/vibroblades/Holocrons to their collection  If you are really dead set on doing the whole dark side thing, and assuming this is during the pre-Clone Wars era, your best bet is to go into business or finance, and keep things as above board as possible. If the Jedi start harassing you, then go public about having been a Sith apprentice, with the help of PR firms and a few puff piece articles in the news. The Republic has freedom of worship, and at least on the face of it, the Sith philosophy isn’t much different from Nietzsche/Ayn Rand type stuff in real life. The Jedi would give you the stink eye, but not much more. The real danger is giving in to dark side urges and ending up murdering a business rival or something like that, then getting arrested by the cops. Either that, or letting the megalomania get out of control and trying for something silly like galactic domination or the destruction of the Jedi, best to leave that to the much better equipped Bane-line Sith  If this was way back before the Ruusan Reforms, back in the bad old days of full on galactic warfare, then your best bet would be to hitch your fortunes to some other Sith master to try and continue your training. This would let you rise up the Sith imperial hierarchy, or eventually let you strike out on your own as some semi-independent warlord under the Imperial fiefdom. Granted, still not a good idea, you’ll most likely end up bisected or turbolasered by Jedi or some disgruntled superior/subordinate, and your short life will be filled with not much more than fear, guilt, anger and extreme paranoia.

Honestly, you don’t even have to start by reading philosophy, you can go on YouTube and watch lectures there instead, to get introductions to specific philosophers and their core concepts. I very strongly recommend you watch Michael Sugure’s channel on YouTube, he was a historian of ideas teaching in Princeton in the 70s and 80s I believe, and he uploaded all of his lectures regarding introductions to core philosophers on his channel. They’re all amazing, and brilliant place to get into different thinkers. Also, another important point: wether we like it or not, we live in time, and everything has a history, including philosophy; so, as much as you can, read philosophy in historical order, and also very importantly, try to understand the historical era in which philosophers were writing in: for instance, you cannot and shouldn’t try to read philosophers from the 17-19th century without understanding more broadly what was going on in Western Europe during that time, namely, the Enlightnemt. Same applies to all the eras- to separate a philosopher from the era in which they were writing would be a big mistake in your path in understanding what exactly they meant: you might, for instance, find some philosophers to be bigots if you don’t take into consideration how revolutionary their ideas were relative to the social context in which they were writing in, because, at the end of the day, a great many of them also had ethical motivations in mind when writing their philosophy, and therefore their writings were meant for the people of their age, not for us, x many centuries later.  As for where to start precisely with reading actual philosophy, I’m sure others have told you this already, but I believe Plato’s Republic is by far the best place to get into philosophy; pay particular attention to the allegory of the cave, and try to understand it as deeply as you can (use your intuition, not just your reason to do so); try to put it into your context as hard as you can. I guarantee that when you understand it properly, your outlook on all of philosophy and its purpose from that point onwards will change forever.  Other than that, I’d tell you to prepare yourself mentally before going into non-rational 20th century enlightenment and American philosophy, because philosophy before the 20th century in America and England was, for lack of a better expression, trippin balls compared to what people in the anglophone world believe nowadays. So yeah, prepare yourself mentally, find people to talk about your thoughts if you can, and be sure to have a stable emotional support system around you, especially once you get to Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, the existentialists, the post structuralists, etc., because, although they have the most amazing and beautiful ideas, they’re also the most kind shattering ones too, so be prepared for when your structure of the world will change.

If the distances are the same, these two effects cancel out, leaving the light looking the way it did when it started.  Edit: The light would also change direction as it passes the black hole, its path bent by the gravitational field, so it's best if the black hole is placed not midway between the friends but off to one side.

I recently attained a job in industry after graduating with a PhD in ME with a focus on mechanics of materials. So, my experience is related to the types of positions for that field.  First of all, let's focus on why you want to get the PhD. You *do not* get a PhD because you think it's going to open up a world of possibilities in that everyone will want to hire you. You get a PhD because you love working on very difficult specific problems which have very likely not even been attempted before. You also like to get to a fundamental understanding behind these problems. You can see how this description aligns perfectly with research. It also opens up a world outside of research pertaining to the most difficult technical challenges an industry or company might encounter.  So, where you work after finishing the PhD? There are 3 primary areas as I see it: (1) academia, (2) national labs, and (3) industry.  * Academia - teaching and research. Currently, it is very difficult to get a tenure-track academic position. The upside of academia is you define your own work and collaborate with some of the best minds in a subject area. The downside is become a glorified program manager immediately - you don't do most of the work, your students do. You are also constantly fighting for funding. Also, normally before you can get a tenure track position you need to complete a 2-3 year stint as a post-doc. * National Lab - research and project work. The work at national labs is fairly varied but you still get to do research-type work. Most national labs require you to enter as a post-doc and then offer you a full-time position as a staff scientist after 1-2 years depending on appointment and the specific lab. The downside is many of these jobs require a security clearance so it's limited to US citizens. The culture at different labs varies greatly and no one is the same as another, e.g., LLNL is very different from ORNL. * Industry - almost all project work. One professor I know has said the age of true industrial research is gone, which in reality is not a bad thing. There are many good and bad things that people have hinted at in this thread. To be honest, this is the area I am least familiar with at this point, but I'll go through some points that I have been brought up by others and what I can say from my experience and the experience of the many PhDs I know who went to work in industry. It's important to note when looking at positions in industry you should take not of some advice I was given by an acquaintance at the NRC. In more or less words: \"I don't hire PhDs for what they currently know and what their academic research topic was. I hire them because the PhD is effectively a license to solve very difficult, ill-defined problems which have no prior answer and push the bounds of current engineering knowledge.\"   I'll try and go through some things about industry:  * \"You are too qualified for most positions and your opportunities are limited\" - This is absolutely 100% true. You are too qualified for most positions and because of that you have limited your opportunities. But, let's assume you got your PhD for the right reasons - research/advanced development oriented work. So, do you really want those jobs? Do you really want to do the normal BS qualified test engineer position? It's not a knock on those positions at all, you just have to make sure you get the PhD knowing full well that you want to do \"research-type\" work. So, even if you were able to get those jobs on an equal playing field, you wouldn't want to do them anyways. * \"In my experience, mostly heavy industries, outside of advanced development and research there very few PhDs around\" - This is again absolutely true. Why would a company want to pay the premium that a PhD demands when they can have someone with a BS or MS do the same work just as effectively. The PhD holds its weight in positions which are normally highly analytical or computational heavy. Projects or areas that would require more specific training and in-depth knowledge. This is what your PhD gives you, the knowledge to solve these very difficult problems. The PhD also says that you can effectively self-teach yourself very difficult new topics. This is what you did during your dissertation research, is it not? You taught yourself to the edge of knowledge of a very specific topic. This has shown you can do this and could do it again. * \"Be commissioned and trusted to develop entirely new methods, or technologies\" - Again, this absolutely true. As I just said above, you know how to push the edge of the unknown. * \"Many employers will be afraid to hire you for fear of you leaving when you realize you are making the same as your BS/MS counterparts\" - If you encounter this, then you're looking in the wrong places. The places that know they need PhDs will know what they're looking for and won't be afraid to hire a PhD. You'll also be paid appropriate for the PhD. There are websites which list the starting salaries of PhDs in different fields, etc. I know the average starting salary of an ME PhD is right around $90k, with that going up or down based on industry and location. The average starting post-doc at a national lab is around $72k, I believe. Is it going to be harder to find a job? Significantly harder but that's because there's significantly less of them available which are appropriate for you. * \"NASA and JPL have position that require at least a masters. Some even require a phd.\" - These are effectively the positions you're looking at when you're looking for jobs. Look around at the jobs postings at most large companies including JPL, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed, GM, GE, etc. You'll see a decent number of positions that are MS required, PhD preferred (note, they even have a decent number of 0 year experience entry level positions with these requirements). A majority of these positions will be computationally focused - think FEA and CFD. Look around at these to get a sense of the jobs that are available to PhDs. * \"You go for industries which look for a specific qualification and there are some of them in which is easier to go up in the 'ranking' thanks to a Ph.D.\" - This is the last point I wanted to make. By having a PhD, you no longer have a ceiling on the technical track at most companies. You'll notice the more senior technical positions will start requiring MS and PhD. Also, these positions are significantly more saturated with PhDs than at the less senior levels.  I hope this helps some. I know it's a wall of text, but I just wanted to give some context from the PhD side of things since we are likely going to underrepresented in a sub like this. If there's any PhDs with more experience in industry, feel free to come by and kick the shit out of my answers. This is just my opinion from my own experience and experience of others I know.  As a note, from personal experience, the job I recently attained is not in a company's research lab. I accepted a position doing high strain rate computational mechanics focusing on fracture phenomena for a large company. The position is in the advanced development arm of the company. FWIW, during the hiring process, the manager told me that they are now hiring a minimum MS with a strong preference for PhDs. Apparently, BS level hires, even with some experience, were not working out doing this work for one reason or another. That's just my experience and I'm entirely sure if it's typical or atypical."}, {"prefer": "i've only ever seen it done to older cars and there it was always a matter of availability. some cars were sold as AT in much higher numbers, or exclusively, think the E46 M3 CSL.

I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.

I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.

I just took an Environmental Engineering course on landfills, and here's the data they gave us:  A person generates around 5kg of waste per day, which includes a tolerance for industrial waste generated by the products that you use (this would be around half of that; definitely needs to be considered). Over a lifetime, that means around 140 tonnes of waste. Typical density of waste varies greatly, but tends to be around 300kg/m^3 before compaction, and up to 600kg/m^3 after.  I assume you're more interested in the non-compacted waste, so that results in a landfill of around 450m^3.

Dialectic builds up to it."}, {"prefer": "So, I’m a economist rather than an anthropologist, but here’s my understanding as what I focus on in part is properties of money, money systems, and the development of national currency.   To begin, as another suggested, you can check out David Graeber for an exploration of this - however, I’d warn that Graeber provides us an anthropology of debt and credit systems... not money. He specifically doesn’t cover the era that territorial monies such as standardized coinage emerged (he ends his analysis in the 1600s).   Eric Helleiner is someone you should check out. In particular, his book on territorial currencies. The answer to your question is that coinage is not common. The Greek city states are earlier forms of this development, but it’s not to state it as a necessary stage in the development of money and nor has it been historically required to facilitate trade. The coinage systems we see emerging entering the industrial revolution are very different, and standardized in order to push other systems of denomination out of circulation. Earlier forms of coinage didn’t have this purpose, but were usually done in a non-standard way (e.g., hammer imprinting and very non-standard) to facilitate trade internationally and in the name of a new King, etc.   In short - there’s nothing special about coinage over and above, say, cowrie shells. I think the answer to your question has to do with the social development of the group in question, their goals (e.g., is there a sovereign trying to coordinate resources to some end?), and their relative place in the global economic structure at the time.   For more in depth reading, I again recommend Eric Helleiner. For something having to do with coinage from antiquity rather than the era of nation states I recommend Michael Hudson, an economist, who has also done some very good work on this with other anthropologists. Alex Semenova and his work on monies in antiquity around the Mediterranean would be of interest to you. G. K. Ingham, A. Mitchell Innes and L. Randall Wray is another grouping that has a credit/state theory of money that may interest you, but it doesn’t answer why one would chose coinage over anything else. Hopefully that helps!  Edit: To make my point more clear with a question. If others coinage is good and plenty to allow internal/external circulation, you have access to it, and it meets your needs... why coin your own money? Just trade. You only coin if you have other social/political goals beyond this with strangers."}, {"prefer": "In the 900s, the Kingdom of Leon (Leon means Lion) was in the Spain/Portugal area.  I don't know how they got their lions, but Spain/Portugal kind of kept them.  In the 1100s, Richard I used them.  Heraldry was kind of formalized, so later designs English and French used them in corners.    Then with Great Briton, Scotland and Ireland also adopted designs containing them from England.  I'd say this is why they're common: the largest countries used them, and over several rulers.  That's not to say Lion-Mermaids, and Unicorns and other mythic beasts weren't commonly used.  Also, many of these lions are \"leopards\", when on crests of Abbots, or bastards.  In the 1500s, the Nordic Countries, Denmark first adopted the lion presumably for \"The Lion of Judea\".

What this means is that if you take a state that has a certain amount of uncertainty - a certain \"distance\" from a particular state where every possibility is equally likely - then the movement of that process through time will never take it closer to or further away from that uncertain state, it will always be no more or less similar to the \"I don't really know\" state than it was before.  So for example, if you measure the magnetic moment of an electron, so that you find which way its little bar magnet is pointing, and then let it move, it will slowly evolve through a set of states, each of which is associated with a particular direction, basically moving around like a top, even though you can't see it, the axis will be just as \"certain\".  This kind of certainty is not the same as classical certainty, because even if the magnetic moment of the electron points sideways, you can still represent that as \"50% up, 50% down\", and by measuring it, force it to pick one, and drop it back into the original axis you started with again, so there will always be uncertainty.  Another way to say it is that quantum systems will still give you answers to questions, even if they are bad answers; if someone is going west and you ask them if they are going north or south, the quantum way to answer is to give a 50:50 chance of giving either option.  But if you keep track of how it *should* be moving, given what you know about it's law of motion, and keep checking whether it is at that point, step by step, you can end up getting a given axis almost 100% of the time, subject to some small amounts of environmental disturbance.  This kind of property, that there is some measurement out there that, if it moves in a synchronised way with a state, will produce reliable classical answers, is called \"purity\", and you can think of a pure state as being fully defined by its starting point and some law of motion, like a classical trajectory.  In contrast, a mixed state hides information, usually because there's some other set of degrees of freedom that are relevant that you don't keep track of.  This state, with lower purity, can be considered a little subjective, in that you can always start by defining a state you have in terms of a mixed state, if you aren't totally sure how well you prepared it in its starting point. In other words, instead of an arrow pointing out of the electron showing where north is, you have a kind of sphere around it on which you've painted a fuzzy probability distribution, giving where you mostly think the north is.  Then you can apply the same unitary transformation, which carries forwards that classical probability distribution, that \"blob\" of options, to other positions around the sphere.  You might discover that your state actually has higher purity than you thought, if you prepare it a lot of times, and find that it consistently gives you the same fixed value step by step, whereas a really mixed state might give you something other than 100% probability of appearing where you expect it to be.  But that basically is unitarity; once you have classical uncertainty, the laws of physics will carry that forwards, not making it better or worse, just moving it around, until you do more measurements to resolve it.  The point about black holes is that they seem to still hide information, while also giving you all the energy back.  You chuck something into a black hole, and you never know what happened to it after that point, but meanwhile, the black hole is getting warm, giving out a gentle buzz of particles from its event horizon.  So you're getting something back, but it doesn't seem to be what you put in.  Or to put it another way, when you set up a black hole in a certain state - if we could build a solar-system sized lab - we don't have a theoretical way to assume that we could just guess what it is going to say next and check step after step after step.  It doesn't seem to just have the quantum \"randomness\" of failing to ask the right questions, but has the pure randomness of there being *no* set of measurements you can do that will give you consistent answers 100% of the time, even if you set it up perfectly. It has actual randomness.  That's the thing people are trying to fix, understand how what goes into a black hole controls what it spits out, so that they can see how the history of the black hole is hidden in its event horizon, so that you can go \"yep, photon leaving from that longitude and latitude, next we'll have a muon leaving there...\" at least in principle, even if such an actual detector is impossible."}, {"prefer": "It's because of the type of education we have in the US before a student goes to college, where they are taught to memorize facts and get the right answer.

This is the same force that makes water crawl up into a paper towel.  If you were to suspend a paper towel vertically with the bottom in water, the water will \"wick\" up into it a surprising distance.    Another is evaporation from the leaves.  This creates \"low pressure\" at the leaves, so the water moves that direction more easily.  As important is that the channels the water moves through to the leaves do NOT allow evaporation.  This is like making the above paper towel very long, and running most of it through a plastic tube, with only the top open to air.  Another is the balance of various chemicals in the plant vs the soil.  This creates osmotic pressure that forces water into the roots, where it is actually under some pressure, which amplifies the two effects above.

He writes:  You want to *live* 'according to nature'? O you noble Stoics, what fraudulent words!

To live - is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is living not valuating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? And even if your imperative 'live according to nature' meant at bottom the same thing as 'live according to life' - how could you *not* do that? Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?- The truth of it is, however, quite different: while you rapturously pose as deriving the canon of your law from nature, you want something quite the reverse of that, you strange actors and self-decievers! Your pride wants to prescribe your morality, your ideal, to nature, yes to nature itself, and incorporate them in it; you demand that nature should be nature 'according to the Stoa' and would like to make all existence exist only after your own image - as a tremendous eternal glorification and universalisation of Stoicism! All your love of truth notwithstanding, you have compelled yourselves for so long and with such persistence and hypnotic rigidity to view nature *falsely*, namely Stoically, you are no longer capable of viewing it in any other way - and some abysmal arrogance infects you at last with the Bedlamite hope that, *because* you know how to tyrannize over yourselves - Stoicism is self-tyranny - nature too can be tyrannized over: for is the Stoic not a *piece* of nature?...

It's where the government says, by decree, that something must be traded for \"exactly X\" (or more than X, or less than X).  It somewhat defeats the market process - instead of something getting more expensive as it gets scarcer or increases in demand, it simply runs out of stock. Or vice versa, you end up with more for sale than can be sold, with the producers unable to sell their wares.  Everyone price controls to some degree though - a minimum wage is an example, rent control in some markets are another example. There are academic defences of the minimum wage, but we'd all be lying if we were to say there's no disadvantages/problems caused by it.  The point of all this, is that Venezuela for a long time has been attempting to price control *everything*. From the price of toilet paper, through to wages, through to electricity, through to even the currency itself.  The latter is a huge one. In Venezuela, the currency must be exchanged for USD at a price decreed by the government. This isn't a fixed exchange rate in the traditional sense (where the central bank builds up \"reserves\" and then sells them at a fixed price) - Venezuela has attempted to do the same purely through decree. The problem with this, is that they overvalue the currency so much that you can't actually trade at the official rate. Nobody (or few) will sell you USD for the price the government says they must.  Markets are all incredibly interconnected, we all depend on foreign trade for prosperity - but even operating a business in Venezuela you're shut out from all of this. Only well connected individuals can buy USD from the government at the official rate, otherwise you're stuck applying for \"allowances\" through application processes that take who-knows-how-long. This means the only way to actually import en-masse in Venezuela is by breaking the law. Using black market currency traders. Can you imagine running a business like that?  Oh. Not that you'd want to operate a business - as per the toilet paper article, if the government feels you're not running with the country's interests at heart, it'll just seize it. This makes everyone incredibly suspicious about investing in the country, and avoiding it completely.  So you have inability to export, inability to import, inability to set your own prices, a government that will seize your company on a whim... all acting to reduce \"aggregate supply\". There's chokes on absolutely everything - you cannot buy foreign stuff, you cannot employ workers except at wages decreed by government, and then you can't even sell your goods except at prices also decreed by the government.  Anyway. With trashed supply, come shortages and/or raising prices (price controls be damned). The government attempts to address all these by bringing in tougher price controls, but they're doomed to fail too. Their economy is choked from top to bottom by controls on everything, people can't produce stuff, can't sell stuff, etc. And with a weak economy comes a low (and falling) exchange rate. Well, it would, except that's price controlled too (so read: falling black market exchange rate).  Then hit oil price crashes. Venezuela has more oil than anyone else (which goes to show how spectacularly shockingly they're being run), which accounts for nearly all their exports - again no doubt largely due to the illegality of currency exchange. So oil price crashes, and their entirely non-diversified economy sinks with it.  Adding on to all of these (even with terrible management economies tend to persevere until there's a combination of things - they're nowhere near as fragile as we think), they've been hit by the worst drought in 47 years. With the drought 3 years running, their dams are now on the brink of empty. For a country that depends on hydro for 73% of their power generation, that's a *huge problem*. One that undoubtedly could have been avoided with better management and contingency planning, but Venezuela has anything but good management.  So what do they do? Well, reduce the number of workdays. Send people home from public sector jobs. Roll blackouts. All things further constricting aggregate supply, further making it harder/impossible to run a business.  With reduced aggregate supply, you can basically either take measures to reduce aggregate demand (like raising taxes), or let inflation erode people's living standards for you. The latter can be extra problematic, as inflation means lower real interest rates, encouraging people to spend further: it can *increase* aggregate demand and trigger all kinds of terrible feedback loops (like getting wage increases due to inflation due to wage increase, etc). Venezuela has all that, but then also a bunch of price controlled stuff experiencing shortages, and just generally the economy is undergoing a slow collapse. It's fascinating to watch.  Oh. And I forgot another big one: they happen to owe a lot of foreign currencies. Somehow, the country needs to bring in USD to repay those public debts. Combine that with the collapse in the export sector, collapse in the electricity sector, massive inflation and shortages out of the wazoo... and yeh, good luck to them with that.  If you ask me (and I'm definitely no authority on the matter), one of the biggest mistakes they made was price controlling their currency. Currencies should be free floating, fixed or managed if you absolutely must, but making it illegal to trade except at a government-determined rate is just the worst possible system excusable never. Argentina until last year had the same system and there is just really not a single thing to recommend it for. Well, that and/or deciding to seize businesses willy-nilly.

Critics point out that there are hardly established truths in these fields, and so Rawls is caught in a dilemma: either enumerate exactly what these truths are (and thus open himself to criticism on this front) or don't, rendering his theory too formal to be of use. The idea here is that Rawls has really punted the difficult questions of social organization down the line while giving the impression that he's come to substantive conclusions. For example, he himself thinks his theory supports both socialist and capitalist modes of organization. If a theory of political organization doesn't decide between something so fundamental to the structure of a society, then what good can it be? (says the critic).  Second, Rawls thinks that there's going to be *deliberation* behind the veil of ignorance which leads to conclusions about the structure of society. But, given that parties behind the original position are formally identical (e.g. minimally rational, with no contingent features influencing their decisionmaking, etc.), it's hard to imagine what this deliberation would look like.

I can't give a super specific answer, but will try to touch on a number of facets you could ask follow-up questions about.  I'm pulling some from previous answers that I have written, but much of this is also new.  A great book on this topic is Leila Ahmed's book *Women and Gender in Islam*, which I will heavily use below.  # Part 1 – Quick Note on Veiling Itself  Because you specifically mentioned it, I wanted to start with a small section on veiling itself.  Veiling was common practice in multiple pre-Islamic societies across the Middle East.  In Assyrian culture wearing a veil separated between a 'respectable' woman and those who were 'up for grabs', so to say.  Upper class women, concubines accompanying those women, and former \"sacred prostitutes\" all had to wear it whereas normal prostitutes and slaves were forbidden from veiling themselves, even so far as being under threat of flogging or having their ears cut off.  Ahmed then writes that this practice spread throughout the upper-class Mediterranean world - from the Levant through to Persia - and also crossed religious lines appearing in Byzantine Christian societies.  Here, Ahmed gives the example of a 10th century Byzantine patriarch who wrote that he only allowed his daughter to go out \"veiled and suitable chaperoned\".  She also notes the reasoning, separating the respectable from the rabble, remains constant even in these other societies.    However, that is not to say that veiling was necessarily widespread in Arabia itself.  Women of the *jahilyya* pre-Islamic period did not normally don a veil. This of course varied from city to countryside, with cities being more likely to veil.  Overall, nowhere was the veil common to the extent of places like neighboring Syria and Palestine.  As you noted in your question, sexual relations in Arabia were more open than in those other societies, with both polygamy and polyandry being present.   Through Muhammad's entire life, the only women who were regularly veiled or secluded were his wives. Through successful revelations received by Muhammad, the practice of veiling and seclusion took hold among them, getting to the point where the phrasing \"she took the veil\" became synonymous to \"she became a wife of Muhammad\".  Various impetuses pushed Muhammad towards these rulings.  For example, it was after he became annoyed with guests staying too long chatting with his wives after dinner that the Sura 33 was revealed, within which verse 54 details that one should only speak to Muhammad's wives from behind a curtain. The word he uses for curtain is *ḥijāb*.  Most westerners associate the word *hijab* with some sort of head-wrap of veil, but it also literally can mean 'veil' in the sense of a curtain.  Verse 59 then gives the commandment to women to \"bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.\"  This is allegedly in response to the \"hypocrites\", mere nominal converts to Islam, harassing Muslim women and claiming to have thought they were slaves.  Finally, I should note that the later second Caliph, Omar, was a proponent of seclusion of women and veiling and actively pushed Muhammad towards this position.  # Part 2 – The evolution of the Woman’s place  This is what I suspect to be the more interesting section – why did Islam develop the way it did, when women played such major roles in pre-Islamic and early Islamic times?  In the *jahilyya*, and within early Islam, women contributed in a number of facets of life.  Women were soothsayers and prophetesses such as Sajah, a Christian woman of the Banū Tamīm who led a force of over 4,000 along with Musaylimah, “The Liar”, in rebellion against the nascent Muslim state.  Like the previous sentence indicates, they were also involved in warfare. They were not only poets, telling stories of the battles and engaging in ritualistic pre-battle exchanges of insults, but also warriors themselves. Umm ‘Umara fought at a number of battles alongside men, eventually losing her hand at the Battle of ‘Uqraba in 634.  Women were heavily involved in early Islamic religious life, providing the many of the *hadith* that came to guide religious life.  It was common for them to remarry, showing there to be a lack of stigma against non-virgins, and often they brought significant wealth to these relationships (Muhammad’s first wife, Khadija, was one such widow.  15 years his senior, she was rich enough to allow Muhammad to not have to work, allowing him to instead focus on his spiritual teachings).   #**So why did this begin to change?**  The changes actually started before the spread of Islam, as merchants in urban Arabian cities were increasingly exposed to the norms and cultures of lands with much more rigid gender roles.  This can be seen as an explanation as to why it was the cities, not the countryside, that first adopted veiling.  However, what brought the changes into hyperdrive was the rapid expansion of the early Islamic Empire.  Not only did this bring increased contact with these foreign cultures, but it also brought an influx of slaves, diminishing the bargaining power of even Arab-born women.   The conquests brought untold wealth to the Arabs.  Even regular soldiers were able to afford slaves, houses, and concubines.  Accordingly, women lost one of their original bargaining chips – the wealth they brought to marriages.  Further, as a condition for surrendering and keeping their place, many Persian and Sassanian nobles converted to Islam. They kept, however, their original cultures.  One of the features that developed around this time was the harem, with a multitude of women being walled off for rich and powerful men, guarded only by Eunuchs.  With easy access to sex slaves, Ahmed argues that the line between “woman” and “object” started to blur.  Men did not need to put up with the demands stipulated by Arab women’s wedding contracts when they had access to sex elsewhere.  Women faced increasingly strict restrictions and were treated increasingly poorly.  Some elite men even went so far as to lament the fact that they had to marry their daughters, as their standards of living would so dramatically fall.  Ahmed included the following poem in her book, written from one noble man to another on the occasion of his daughter’s death.  This did not come from a sense of general misogyny, that daughters were worthless, but rather from the degradations and humiliations their daughters were liable to face.   > To Abu Hasan I offer condolences.   > At times of disaster and catastrophe   > God multiplies rewards for the patient.   > To be patient in misery   > Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.   > Among the blessings of God undoubtedly   > Is the preservation of sons   > And the death of daughters.  But cultural and economic changes are only a portion of the story.  Also in play was the religious framework that marriage operated within. Islamic law works through a local judge, a *Qadi*, issuing a ruling on a specific case so that it is in line with religious teachings (we have to note that there was no separation between the illegal and the immoral, but rather they were the one and the same).  However, while the Qur’an protected women’s rights in a number of areas, judges often interpreted these not as legally binding rules, but rather as binding only upon the individual’s conscience.  So, a man would not be legally bound to treat his 4 wives fairly, even if that is a stipulation within the Qur’an itself. There was, in essence, the loss of many Qur’anic provisions that could protect women.  The 11th century also brought the *Closing of the Gates of Ijtihad*.  That is, Islamic jurisprudence reached a point where they (allegedly) decided that there had been sufficient rulings in the past that any questions which need an answer were answerable, and it is was longer necessary to use independent reasoning to come to new solutions (for more on this, see my answere [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7vynzv/when_and_why_did_muslim_countries_stop_using_the/dtwak37/))  This in essence froze many Islamic teachings. There are 4 main schools of Sunni Islamic thought, and at the point of the closing of the gates of Ijtihad, only the Maliki school allowed for women to obtain a divorce on the grounds of desertion or cruelty. Meanwhile, only the Hanafi school fully enforced marriage contracts that would bind a man to monogamy.  While before the closing of these gates a judge could, theoretically, use his own reasoning to analogize and come to a new ruling, they were now largely bound to *taqlid*, imitation of the past. So, these doctrines, along with countless others controlling women’s lives, ceased to develop at the same speed as before.  That is not to say that women were completely locked out, as one could effectively “shop” between the different schools of thought for the most favorable ruling.

There are two possible explanations here.  Either you weigh less than your brother by enough that the Doctor wanted you to have a decreased dose, or it might be that you were being treated for a different indication of the drug that required a lower dose (i.e. urinary tract vs. sinus infection: a UTI would require a lower dose because it is readily filtered into the urine).  It's also likely that either dose would be effective.  >What serum level is necessary to ache]ive a sufficient MIC?  O.K... Now you could delve into the literature or talk to a microbiologist about this one, but I'm a pharmacist and practically no one memorizes this information(especially not Doctors :P).  This is because at some point lots of studies were done on this drug and the doses were devised to satisfactorily treat a bacterial infection based on the MIC.  What is *much much more* important is the concentration of the drug in the *target area* of the infection unless you are talking about treating sepsis, an infection of the blood.  The doses have been formulated to meet and keep the drug level above the MIC in the *target area.*  If you are talking about a sinus infection, then the drug's half life is no longer it's \"biological half life\" reference value because the kidneys aren't rapidly filtering out the drug from the mucous in your nose and sinuses.  >Should a higher dosage do nothing but get a faster steady state? Otherwise the 250 bid dosage would be useless? But if the MIC gets achieved with just 250mg bid wouldn't the 500mg be useless?  This drug, unlike most drugs(but like almost all beta-lactam antibiotics) don't really depend on a steady state in the blood for their effect.  They are given in big bolus doses and they diffuse into the sinuses, lungs, etc. and work there because they aren't being filtered out by your kidneys any longer.  This is also why much lower doses are needed with many antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections.  The drugs naturally concentrate themselves in the urine.  >Any in-depth explanation how half life works, and how it affects the effect of drugs, not just Cerufoxim specific, would be HIGHLY appreciated!

Shedding that is the first step of philosophy and loosens the attachment to the shadows on the cave wall.  I suppose we could say another step is the cultivation of the cardinal virtues, further loosening our attachments to those shadows and gaining the ability and strength to tread the philosopher's path.  One must become capable of \"looking away\" instead of remaining transfixed, which means identifying and shedding all the things that keep us staring at the wall.  Once we've become able to look away we could probably identify the further steps of actually standing up and walking out of the cave by the old Delphic saying \"know thyself\". And perhaps the dramas of the Mysteries (Elusinian etc.) are where we'd find hints of how how one actually exits the cave.  So leaving the cave is twofold: 1) lose our double ignorance (accept that we don't know anything) and our attachments (or summed up as: loosen whatever keeps us transfixed by the shadows), and 2) coming to replace our ignorance with real knowledge (which is the path of Philosophy)."}, {"prefer": "Just to address this from a different perspective, ie why is the Holocaust considered unique, I will link to an answer by  u/commiespaceinvader to the question \"When people discuss the Holocaust, why do they focus mainly on the killing of the 6 million Jews?\"]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/564gvm/comment/d8g92dz/).  Specifically:  >\"In short the Western imagination of itself had experienced atrocities and horrors inflicted against political opponents, \"deviants\", and colonial subjects but it had never experienced that all it used to define itself as good and progressive – the modern state and its bureaucracy, industry, science, the police – was used to murder an entire group of European peoples.\"  It's old but I will also link to a [comment by u/400-rabbits on Stannard, which adds a bit of complexity - there are multiple historic Holocausts and they are all unique, if interrelated.  One thing I will add in addition to those answers is that when one is comparing the Holocaust to Indigenous peoples of the Americas, you're dealing with vastly different things in terms of time and scale - it's not just a numbers game. When we are talking about indigenous peoples of the Americas, we are discussing hundreds of different groups, who had very different experiences at the hands of different actors. Which is to say it makes it hard to talk about a singular \"genocide\" - the answer from u/EdHistory101 specifically focuses on the United States government in the 19th and 20th centuries, but that is part of a much larger history of conflict and dispossession of indigenous peoples lasting from the 1490s to literally this very moment, involving a vast array of actors. To be more comparable you'd probably need to compare the entire history of European anti-semitism from 1492 to the present.   The Holocaust itself is historically a much more concentrated event, involving one government as a prime mover (the NSDAP regime in Germany), which intentionally targeted Jews in Europe for industrialized mass killing, most of which took place over a three year period during the war (ETA a 2019 study found 25% of Holocaust victims were actually murdered in a three month period). Not only was this genocide extremely intentional and organized and planned to an exceptional level of detail, but Germany made it an overriding policy objective, even in its relations with friendly/allied countries - there were even low-level discussions between German and Japanese officials about the possibility of murdering the 20,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai (the Japanese refused).   However, even with that said I should point out via this thread that there is an ongoing historic debate at the moment as to how much white settlement of the Americas directly inspired Nazi policies and goals in Eastern Europe."}, {"prefer": "This is a much more complicated question than you might think. Which vaccine? Protection against infection, transmission, hospitalization, death? How long after vaccination? Actual protection, or surrogate measures like antibody titers?  What age group?  —and of course these all overlap, so asking about protection against hospitalization in elderly people 8 months after vaccination in the UK might not tell you much about protection against infection in 30-year-olds in the US.  The ballpark answer is that alpha and delta have minor to moderate reductions in vaccine efficacy, and beta has a larger reduction, relative to the original strain. Putting together a bunch of studies, and simplifying wildly, if you’re starting with an mRNA vaccine and you received it fairly recently you might have 95% protection against symptomatic disease from the original strain, maybe 80-90% protection against symptomatic disease from alpha and delta, and maybe 60-75% against beta. Scale all those numbers down some if you’re further out from your vaccine, if you’re asking about protection against asymptomatic infection, if you’re elderly or immune compromised.   Another way to look at it is to ask how much difference in antibody concentration you need to neutralize the same numbers of each virus. If you need 1x amount of antibody to neutralize your little vial of original strain, you might need 5x that amount for alpha and delta, and 8-12x as much for beta. Antibody titers don’t correlate linearly with protection, and a ballpark estimate might be that mRNA vaccines give you 10-50x as many antibodies as you need for protection, against original strain, on day 1.  So if antibodies wane by half over a year, you might still be protected against original strain, but mildly susceptible to delta.   Bottom line is that alpha and delta (as well as the D614G mutation that appeared early in 2020 and that everyone has already forgotten about) are mainly transmission-enhancing variants, with immune evasion as a mostly accidental side effect. The beta variant seemed to be more of an immune evasion variant without much transmission enhancement, and so it’s not surprising it was outcompeted and seems to be fading away.   There’s very little published on some other variants of concern. “Mu” never really was a cause for concern, just media hysteria. Lambda is more of a concern, but I don’t know of any good comparative immunity studies on it. It’s behaving more like a moderate transmission variant that’s outcompeted by delta, but who knows.  This tweet, from a well respected virologist, has the beginnings of a table comparing delta immunity to previous strains, and gives a sense of how complicated the question is and how much variation in the answers there is depending on the study - a reminder that scientists almost never rely on a single paper for conclusions and really want to see many different groups ask the question in many different ways before having any trust in the conclus8on."}, {"prefer": "If you're driving at low speeds, you'll probably be fine.

Thanos has probably about the best absolute victory percentage of all the straight up villains in the Marvel universe.  Lets review:  He wants the cosmic cube, beats a whole lot of asses to get it, and then loses it because he agrees to fight someone fist to fist without powers.  The first time he went to get the infinity gems, at the time known as the soul gems...he got them. Despite lots of heroes trying to stop him and the fact that one hero wore the gem on his forehead, he got them all. If the universal abstracts of Law and Order don't show up to stop him, he destroys the universe for Death.  So he dies and is resurrected by Death, and immediately goes after the gems again, *and gets them*, busting through 6 Elders of the Universe to do it and making them into the Infinity Gauntlet. He is now 2 and 0 when it comes to getting these gems.   How is not running the universe right now? He was so busy monologuing that he *let his daughter snatch the gauntlet off his hand* while he was off playing God. Yes, Thanos got punked. Before that? Flawless victory.  Thanos next has a run in with ultimate power in an alternate universe where he actually wins, I mean, completely and totally wins, and then...finds out that he doesn't want it. Really, winning didn't do the trick. So he sacrifices himself to remake the universe.  The thing with Thanos is simple. If you catch him on an ordinary Tuesday and fight him about something he doesn't really care about, you can stop him if you bring enough heavyweights. If he really wants what he's going for or decides to give you his full attention and prepares for the fight? You're probably not going to win. But, in the end, and even Thanos himself knows this, he's really going to beat himself if the stakes are high enough.  Now all this is 616 Thanos. Everyone in the MCU is about 5 or so times less powerful that they are in the 616. There might be all kinds of ways you can beat Thanos in the MCU, for all we know."}, {"prefer": "I've been there. My first course on phenomenology was absolutely humbling. Either way:  Husserl's goal is to solve what he believed to be the greatest epistemological crisis of science in general. He noticed how the sciences had been limited to the physical world by Galileo and Descartes so they could study mechanics, but, due to its great success, this method kept being used.   However, scientists very quickly forgot that they were not studying \"the world\" but only a self-limited version of it (the physical world, where anything that's not quantifiable by the methods of physics gets left out as not existing). Until here, all good, right? Sort of. The problem is that science is an empirical science, which is based on perception, which is something we have access to through our subjective view of the world, i.e., the objective world of sciences is grounded upon the subjective world of perception.   But sciences work, and give good results, right? Yes, they do. But, for Husserl, the matter is that science, as section of our culture, has as its goal to uncover the truth, not merely subjective or \"practical\" truths. Therefore, a new way of doing science is needed, so that science can have a strong, unwavering foundation.  Husserl saw a talk by Brentano (a naturalistic psychologist of the late 19th century) where he exposed what Husserl believed to be one of the greatest discoveries of psychology ever: the intentionality. This is the base structure of conscious acts, i.e., everything that we do with our minds has this structure: the act itself (believing, doubting, seeing, hearing, wanting, etc.), the content (a door, a dog, happiness, a theory, a smell, etc.), and a degree of existence (i.e., when we hear our friends tell us about their childhood, it has a different status as when we read about Harry Potter's childhood. Not because the latter is a \"lie,\" but because it is fictional).  Husserl arrived at this point by using one of his methods: the eidetic or phenomenological reduction and the epoché. This reduction method, i.e., allows you to figure out the \"essence\" of things by changing things about this thing as much as  you want without it not being that thing anymore and the epoché is a suspension of knowledge we have acquired from the natural world (i.e., not using things learned about the natural world to explain the subjective experience that precedes it, otherwise we would remain in an epistemological problem). You can do this with doors, changing color, size, form, etc. to understand the point. But Husserl's goal was not metaphysics, he was studying the subjectivity, so, what he did was use this method on mental structures to figure them out (like in the case of the intentionality that's present in all intentional acts). (There's also the transcendental reduction, but that one is probably not as relevant for you right now.)  He did this to many other mental structures, construction of time (past, present, future), empathy/intropathy (perceiving the other as a subjectivity like ourselves), construction of spatial objects, etc.  Important to note: 1) phenomenology is *descriptive* endeavor: it does not explain things regarding subjectivity, it merely describes them as they are; 2)  phenomenology is entirely restricted to the domain of subjectivity, it does not make claims about the natural world. It is entirely restricted to the study of subjectivity. It does not do metaphysics.   I hope I was of help.

For example, in WW2, the war in Europe was quite different from the war in the Pacific, and Nazi Germany only supported Japan because Japan was fighting against the US.  The First World War wasn't at all a case of Germany taking on the rest of the world, or even the rest of Europe. Basically, at the time, Europe had divided itself into two blocs, the idea being that if a country attacked another country, then that country's allies would retaliate -- and so, in theory, peace was assured because no country would be foolish enough to start a war. Unfortunately, political tensions were high in parts of Europe, and when a Serbian terrorist assassinated an Austrian aristocrat, this gave Austro-Hungary the excuse to issue an ultimatum to Serbia that Serbia couldn't possibly accept, and this set in motion a kind of domino effect: Austro-Hungary declared war on Serbia, so Russia mobilised its troops, so Germany mobilised *its* troops and invaded Belgium, so Britain declared war on Germany. Basically, the various European countries declared war on each other until the whole lot of them were slugging it out in the trenches.  The Second World War was primarily caused by German aggression, although Germany wasn't alone: Italy, too, was on Germany's side. Hitler secured a pact with Stalin so he could concentrate on the western front. Germany had made huge advances in military technology and had been gearing up for war for a time, and also employed, very successfully, the tactic of \"blitzkrieg\": a sudden, powerful, early strike against the enemy to overwhelm them before they could properly respond. The Allies, still recovering from the First World War, had attempted to appease Hitler; when Hitler came to power, they had persuaded themselves that he was a jumped-up lunatic who was all bark and no bite, and would never be able to actually do anything.

An easy example is the sacredness of cows in India.  Harris came to the conclusion that this was a practice that evolved from the underlying usefulness of cows in that particular area of the world.  A well-kept cow provides milk, yogurt calves, plowing of fields, manure for fertilization... many benefits beyond that of beef meat.  As such, it became ingrained in culture that cows were not for eating.  In essence, beliefs have a function.  Otherwise they don't stick around.  Obviously Ancient Egyptian religion (from around 5000 years ago)  has not provided that function, and therefore has not persisted.  The predominant religion in the world, Christianity, has been around for 2000 years, has probably provided the world with some function during that time, or else it would no longer exist; it is, however, shrinking.  Hinduism is upwards of 3500 years old; Buddhism around 2500.  Currently the fastest growing religions are Islam and atheistic/none.  One has to assume that each of these has a specific function, and that people are drawn to them based on their need at that point in time.

We have yet to figure out whether or not we'll be around as a species for the next 200 years.  I'm more worried about that.

For one, the expansion of the Russian empire from the 15th to 20th centuries eastward from Europe has lead to many Turkic and Finno-urgic people's to identify as ethnically and culturally Russian.   Another, is that in Argentina where only 1.6% of Argentines identify as Amerindian and most identify culturally as white European. However in actuality, some studies have shown that much of the population is actually genetically mestizo.   The Goths, Vandals and other German ethnolinguistic groups, were eventually subsumed into the modern German ethnicity.   The Gauls in pre-Roman Europe were a tribal ethnic group that were subsumed into the invading Roman Empire. Becoming \"Romanized\" (although I hate the use of that word) through imperial conquest and forced subjugation.   So yes there are many examples of ethnic groups merging and becoming one, or one being subsumed into the other. It has happened all across the world, but for varying reasons. Yes, there are many ethnic groups that strive to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage but given enough time and proximity, and the right historical circumstances, it is not uncommon to see a merging of ethnic groups.

Russian cultural attitudes towards sexuality are more or less what they've always been.  The Western world has changed a lot in its attitude towards homosexuality, sexuality and gender- Russia not so much.  So the \"origins of\" - really lie as much in  the West as in Russia. North Americans had similar attitudes towards, say, same sex marriage as Russia does - in 1990. Our ideas changed, theirs not so much. Russia has always had a very ambivalent relationship with ideas from the West -sometimes embracing them, only to become less enthusiastic and then to repudiate them.  There was some impulse towards \"erotic glasnost\" in the 1990s, but didn't get that far.   Russia retains some aspects of Soviet era health and morality policies - abortion and divorce were part of the secularization that followed the Bolshevik revolution, and have substantially \"stuck\" in the culture. Homosexuality, though, while decriminalized after 1920, was substantially suppressed by Stalin.  You might compare with Poland - politically aligned against Putin's Russia, but culturally the Law & Society Party have very similar views about gender and sexuality. Indeed, Russia is notable in still basically allowing abortion up to 12 weeks, while its been essentially abolished in Poland.  See  * Costlow, Jane T., Stephanie Sandler, and Judith Vowles, eds.

The irrational animals all possess only their will - what differentiates man, what Aristotle called the rational animal, from the rest is that man has the faculty of reason in addition to will, which allows us to deliberate on our acts; this is what gives us our freedom to choose between goods.  Irrational animals, however, do not have reason; instead, they have only the appetites - the will. So they all will things based on their appetites (i.e. they act according to instinct and in response to stimuli, but they cannot deliberate on their acts and choose accordingly like man can). They may appear to deliberate, such as if an ape is given a puzzle of some kind, but they are unable to actually reason about it; at best, they may follow an instinctual algorithm, such as a computer might do, such as trial and error problem solving. They could not, however, consider universals and reason about them; they could not, for example, reason about triangles and deduce that the degrees of their three inner angles must always add up to the same number.  This idea has also been picked up by modern philosophers in Animal Cognition (SEP article for reference), such as Donald Davidson, who (to roughly summarize) argued that the ability to reason is tied to language and belief - since reason is consideration of things in the mind, it must include an understanding of things different from mere observation of reality, and so there must be the ability to be surprised: to quote:  > Surprise shows that one can discriminate between the purely subjective and the objective. In order to have the capacity to be surprised, and therefore to have beliefs, one needs the concept of belief, to be able to understand that there is an objective reality that is independent from our beliefs. At the same time, language is necessary to have the concept of belief, for it allows us to contrast what we believe with what others believe, and thus generate the notion of truth and an objective reality.

The bottom of the roll needs to lightly stick to the surface you are rounding on.

The cost of generating electricity and delivering it to your home can be more expensive than delivering gas on a cost per energy basis.

If you look at the energy being delivered to the house you see that it is 0.3 units for electric and 1.4 units for gas.  As an example, If you consider the cost of electricity to be say $50/unit and the cost of gas is $10/unit then the electric bill for the heat pump would be $15 per unit of heat ($50x0.3 units) and $14 per unit of heat for gas ($10x1.4 units).

Sugrue is more or less shooting the breeze with his daughter in relation to a chapter she just read - I don't say \"about\" because they don't say anything about the subject of that chapter, the relationship between the colonized subject and language.  What Sugrue does say is puzzling and on a range between accidentally deceptive to the audience (when he talks about emotion and violence) to just wrong (when he talks about the reversal of colonialism ending with nothing other than amoral black supremacy).  Moreover, parts of his analysis are weirdly self-contradictory, as when he seems to criticize Fanon's psychologism, and then basically gives a (incredibly superficial) psychologistic reading of Fanon as being, basically, a very mad dying guy who is angry about \"every slight\" ever visited on him.  Yet, later, it seems like he more or less cops to the idea that colonialism was horrible and genocide is horrible and that atonement is necessary, but, like, the idea that this atonement might itself be violent is, I guess, so unimaginable that Fanon is just a guy \"with matches.\"  As you estimate, this just can't be a very good reading of Fanon, and I don't think it really intends to be.  I think we could and should reasonably criticize him for putting this nonsense out into the ether, but it's plainly non-serious discourse where he's just kind of dishing dissess and platitudes with his daughter as the two of them share cross-generational catholic angst about the downfall of western civilization thanks to the bankruptcy of academia - he a late/end career Great Books professor and she an undergraduate struggling through the detritus of the 20th century post-blah-blah humanities.  So, anyway, I think the question here ought to be reigned in with respect to what happens.  Is Sugrue reliable?  Well, about what and in what setting?  I'm not really sure what we could take him to be reliable *about* here because he doesn't really talk about anything specific in much level of detail and, when it does, it's a kind of weird mess (as you suggest).  Now, compare this to what his old *Great Courses* lectures are like.  They're prepared, for one thing, and they're specific and exegetical, for another thing.     So, centering this on the person is, I think, likely to be confounding because a person can do a lot of things in a lot of contexts.  If you want an entertaining (if partial, because of how he see's Plato historically) detailed exegesis of Plato, then his old lectures are great.  And, to his credit, he's actually a pretty serviceable interpreter of Nietzsche and (at least back when he did his old *Great Courses* lectures) gives a pretty sensitive reading of Nietzsche.  (He calls him both one of the greatest thinkers in the whole western tradition, and also calls him a racist, mysoginist, and anti-semite.)

In the late 9th century? Or, around the turn of the millennium (so-called \"Late/ Second Viking Age)?    If the former is indeed the case, the situation would have been much closer to that of Iceland, discussed by /u/glasgallow and linked by /u/BookQueen13 below. It was not until the middle of the 10th century that now Denmark saw somewhat stable, unified (and supra-local) polity in form of Jelling dynasty after the collapse of the Godfred-Horik dynasty around the middle of the 9th century.     On the other hand, if OP ('s supposed war veteran) lived under the reigns of the Jelling rulers like Svend Forkbeard or Cnut the Great, he (as a war veteran, I primarily regard the Dane in question as \"him\" in order not to go into the details on the woman's legal capacity in Viking Age and Medieval Danish laws) might get interfered by the superior authority beyond the local society level like these kings.    Another possibly (and most probably) problematic premise in OP's question is the assumption that he the Dane ex-Viking] could use press his claim by resorting almost solely to the practice of *holmgang* with ease there either in the late 9th century or in the 10/11th centuries.    The study of conflict settlement in medieval Europe (including Scandinavia and Iceland) has advanced greatly especially since 1970s, with help of the anthropological approach as well as feud study, initiated early in the 20th century by Otto Brunner. From their point of view, the use of violence and the judicial process were not dichotomous (mutually exclusive), but often complemented each other to reach an agreement between both parties involved with - that now we regard as an primary goal of a series of conflicts.    As for the social meaning of not unlimited/ ritual use of violence in early medieval society (though not in Viking Age Scandinavia in a narrow sense), I also recommend you to check /u/EndOfTheWorldGuy's recent post in: [Was the need to go to great lengths to defend ones honor as vain as we perceive it today in our modern times? How important was it to gain and protect honor besides the obvious reasons of ego?.   Another trend since 1970s that has affected the alleged importance of *holmgang*, or the legal text recorded later on medieval parchments in general, is a revisionism in the character of medieval Scandinavian law books (codes). These law texts had often been regarded as a residue (or at least including residue layer) of the Viking Age society and sometimes used for the comparative analysis to reconstruct the distant past, but now more and more scholars got used to analyze them primarily as the product of a social change in later times, especially the High Middle Ages when these texts were codified (, though a few scholars has countered this revisionist trend further now).   The majority of study on the *holmgang* had been published until 1970s - thus belonged to the older (now dated) approach of conflict settlement as well as the legal culture of the Viking Age Scandinavia. In other words, less and less scholars are now not so sure about the possibility that Viking Age Scandinavians actually practiced *holmgang* to settle the conflict widely, exact as specified in one of High Medieval Swedish lawbooks as well as some sagas of the Icelanders.   Aside from these two changing trend of research as well as the essential primary texts, however, we mainly have two more problems to take OP's case into consideration:    1. As Vogt remarks, we have not so ideal- or very limited amount of primary sources for the study on the judicial practice in Medieval Denmark. Almost no court record is extant until the end of the 14th century, and almost no record of judgement for whole the Middle Ages (prior to the Reformation in Denmark in 1536) (Vogt 2014: 185f.).   1. While medieval Danes almost certainly knew the concept of *holmgang* itself, we rely mainly on one specific person - Saxo Grammaticus for Viking Age Denmark. 13th century lawbooks don't explicitly refer to the *holmgang* as a judicial practice at all.    +++    Then, what Saxo (about 1200) says about the *holmgang*, or exactly speaking, its abolition?    Saxo mentions duels across the first half of his work (legendary pre-history part), but not so much in his latter, history (10th/ 11th century onward) part. He actually mentions its abolition twice, in somewhat contradictory manners:    1. At the time of conversion of King Svend Forkbeard by Poppo's ordeal (around the turn of the millennium) (Saxo, X-xl-4, in: Christiansen trans. 1980: 21): \".....The Danes abolished the custom of judicial duelling, and that decreed that various cases should be settled by this kind of ordeal.\"   1. For the second time, Saxo ascribes the total eradication of the practice of judicial combats under the reign of King Harald Hen (r. 1074/76-80), as he comments as following (Saxo XI-x-7, in: Christiansen trans. 1980: 72): \"For it seems to posterity that law-disputes are better settled by swearing than by steel.\"    For me, these accounts suggest that Saxo certainly regarded the trial \"by steel\" (judicial combat) somewhat as archaic way of settlement, but we cannot know the details of former practices only based on these accounts alone.    +++    Provincial codes from the 13th century generally specify the testimony with oath by the respected person in the district as a means to settle the problem, and I wonder whether similar way could have also been taken before in some cases.   To give an example, *The Law of Jutland (1241 CE)* stipulates on the boundaries between the field as following:    >\"If men disagree about boundaries between fields, then men of truth of the district shall mark it with stakes or with stones and thereafter swear at that place where there is disagreement that they have done it rightly. If it is both on the boundary between fields and between districts that they disagree, then four from one district and four from the other districts, those that live closest, shall decide and swear according to what they know most truthfully they have done it right, and then make it public at the assembly. But if there is any memory that it had been sworn to before, and any man is alive of those who swore, then it shall not be sworn to again. But if there is no memory that it had been sworn to before, and the king will have the boundaries settled by riding, then it will also fully stand; however, he must not come without notice so that it is secret to some of those who are parties in the dispute. It is safer that the boundary between the fields be sworn to than ridden, the those know best who live the closest.....(*The Law of Jutland*, II-21, English translation is taken from: [Tamm & Vogt trans. 2016: 261f.].\"     If similar system was applied to the conflict settlement for OP's case, the personal connection either with local or with the external political authority must have played an important role - since the king should also appoint \"men of truth\" (*The Law of Jutland*, II-1~4, Tamm & Vogt trans. 2016: 258). Before the royal appoint became norm, it is also likely that such a role should have been played by the local elders or possibly the chieftain (perhaps on behalf of the king).      +++    On the other hand, surprisingly enough, it was not until the almost end of the Middle Ages that not only the nobles, but also the peasants sometimes employ the violence as a means to push their claim against their peers (that is to say, peasant vs peasant) in medieval kingdom of Denmark. Denmark did not have a unified kingdom-wide law code like Norway, and the monopoly of violence by the kingship did not easily achieved in practice, researchars argues.    There have been some excellent scholarships on such \"bondefejde\", so if OP can read Danish, [Fenger 1971] can be recommended as the classic of the topic.
