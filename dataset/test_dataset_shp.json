{"post_id":"ulparn","history":"What was Wittgenstein's actual level of expertise in mathematics and logic? The other day I was wondering what would be Wittgenstein's contributions to mathematics if he decided to be a mathematician instead of a philosopher. I engaged in conversation online on this topic and the other guy's opinion was pretty interesting. He was very critical of Wittgenstein. He said:   \" Wittgenstein actually had glaring gaps in his understanding of mathematical logic.  E.g., in the Tractatus, he argues against Russell's Paradox on the basis that a function \"can't be its own argument,\" which one reviewer described as \"appearing philistine and arrogant\" (in light of the untyped Lambda Calculus), and which seems to have been based on a misunderstanding of the origin of the paradox  that it stemmed from Basic Law V of Frege's Begriffsschrift admitting the course\/range of values of a function (i.e., sets of ordered pairs) and extensions of \"concepts\" (predicates) as objects in the domain of discourse.  But one can actually prove easily that \u2203x\u2200y(y \u2208 x <-> \\~(y \u2208 y))  leads to a contradiction in \\*First-Order Logic\\* (meaning \\~\u2203x\u2200y(y \u2208 x <-> \\~(y \u2208 y)) is a theorem of FOL).   So the actual culprit is naive, unrestricted set comprehension, not the second-order nature of Frege's system.    His writings also display a shocking lack of understanding of Godel's Incompleteness theorems.  He also made no formal contributions to mathematical logic (in terms of proving novel metatheorems).   There's no \"Wittgenstein's theorem,\" for example.   Compare him with a powerhouse like Tarski, who derived numerous fundamental results in mathematical logic (e.g., the upward and downward arbitrary cardinal versions of the Loweheim-Skolem Theorem), and also made contributions to the philosophy of logic (e.g., on the nature of the logical consequence relation, and the argument for the primacy of the semantic version over the syntactic version). \"  Can anybody here confirm this? It seems like he knows what he's talking about. At the same time, I find it strange that the philosopher which Russell considered to be his successor would turn out to be a mediocre logician.","__index_level_0__":10213}

However, this is an issue I have with our general culture (mainly the US) that I think needs to be addressed.   For decades we have mocked the idea of old people in all types of media, decided older features are \"ugly\" and generally cast them aside. The general public seems indifferent at best to seniors to downright abusive. Greedy for their money in wills, willing to target their homes for robbery- even outright inciting violence against seniors. From The Simpson's Grandpa Abe to Family Guy's Herbert, we also end up treating them as creepy or just a drag to listen to (not to knock those shows, I love em myself).  I think we need to treat older people with more respect, because after all they were once our age. They once ran marathons, fought wars... They have so many stories to share and HISTORY to contribute. To treat them as second class is downright awful. I'm not arguing every old person is a saint, but I can't get over that someone as sweet as my own great grandma is the target of harassment and scams. That she's seen as ugly just for being 83.

{"post_id":"7xdpo8","history":"CMV: I think it is ridiculous that people and the media throw a fit when illegal immigrants are deported. As of late, many different stories have risen about immigrants, some of which have been in the United States a long time, are being deported. I read an article today about a man who called the police for help. Afterward, he was handed over to ICE.   Immigrating to the United States illegally is obviously a crime. Crimes have punishments\/courses of actions that are clearly presented in laws. Deportation is often the punishment for illegal immigration.   People seem to think that because an illegal immigrant has been in the United States for many years, that them being deported is wrong. If it was a bank robber who was caught 10 years after the fact no one would be upset that he faces his punishment. So I don\u2019t think people should be upset when illegal immigrants are deported regardless of how long they have been here.   Note: I realize that some people are brought here as children. That makes things more complicated since that is not really their fault that they were brought here. It is their parents or guardians that brought them here illegally. However, it is not the United States government\u2019s fault that they were brought here illegally by someone and no blame or anger should be directed at the government and ICE agents for carrying out the law regardless if previous administrations enforced the law or not.   Maybe I am not seeing people\u2019s issue with the situation. It could be that they are saddened that someone has to uproot their life, but if we look at my example of the bank robber, is he\/she not also being uprooted from their life?","__index_level_0__":16186}

The reason I specify European programs is because I think that the requirements for US PhDs (not sure about other countries) are a bit more vague.   My funding runs out in just over 3 months, and I've published more than the paper minimum needed to defend. However, I'm wondering if supervisors can prevent students from defending anyway if they feel that they haven't done enough work or if they feel the student hasn't mastered a certain subject.  My supervisors have been pretty vocal about the fact that I haven't done enough work for the PhD, which I feel is unfair for a number of reasons.

I was being late to school because id spend so much time straining in the morning. I told my parents that week that i hadnt been able to poop all week and they made me a black coffee with coconut oil. it kind of helped, but the constipation continued despite no change in my life style.  I was taken to the doctor around december and even though i was drinking plenty of water, i had a smoothie before the appointment so my pee was more yellow than usual, and the doctor just rubbed it off as me needing to drink more water.  (2020) I continued for about a year only pooping once a week, and needing a laxative to do so. I started getting extremely bloated and not wanting to eat or even drink water because i felt so full and it hurt.  I ended up waking up one day extremely nauceous and threw up, and i threw everything since my lunch from the previous day completely undigested.  This cycle continued where id be constipated all week, get sick and throw up undigested food at the end and use a laxative as an emergency. I was taken to the doctor again and she told me I need to eat more (even though I was eating a normal amount, a pretty equal and balanced diet actually)  I was at my massage therapist and told her about my issues and that it hurt to lay on my stomach, she started feeling my stomach and gut and told me that she felt some sort of mass in my gut and tried to gently massage it, but told me to go to the doctor and demand answers.  (2021) I was taken to the doctor and this one actually listened, she had me do an x ray and they found that I was full of poop, pushing on my organs, making me llook bigger, and pushing on my lungs as well, all the way up to my lungs was poop build up. The doctor was extremely bothered that none of the doctors before me paid attention to my complaints and said this was extremely dangerous. They said it seemed like my digestive system wasnt working properly\/failed  They planned another visit for me to have testing done, but till then had me to a colonoscopy prep(for 7 days) to empty my bowls so that the medical risk went down. I was so excited to finally get relief  Nothing happened  About 3 days in of taking 7 laxatives a day i got a little but of diareah, but it was like it was leaking around it and not actually emptying it out. It was a normal amount.  When i finally got the test done, they said that my bowel muscles seemed to be working fine and that they wernt sure what was wrong, they told me to not eat much and try to drink mainly liquids till they could figure out the problem, but they just never followed up?? So eventually i started eating normal again.  Ive since moved and am not with my parents doctor anymore, but the constipation has only gotten worse. Everytime i poop i need to strain so hard and almost always bleed feel my anus tearing no matter how small it is. Sometimes 1 tiny circle poop comes out and abunch of blood and blood clots\/clumps is a majority of whats in the toilet and it gets everywhere.  Another thing i noticed is that the non tiny poops\/normal ones are extremely too big for the hole, and almost flat, so the hole cant gradually expand to let it out, like a cone shape. If the hole is 1 inch open the base of the poop is 2 1\/2 inches or more.  pooping makes my body so sore and shakey and it covers the toilet and my hands in blood.

{"post_id":"xhfz84","history":"CMV: Mentioning gender is unnecessary in all but the most niche interactions and informing people of one's sex makes more sense To start with some definitions:   By gender, I mean the cultural identity that loosely related to sex as a concept, but is not inherently bound to it. I believe this understanding coincides with how businesses and the dictionary defines it, but I recognize I could be misinterpreting something.  In this case, by unnecessary I mean that it is almost wholly irrelevant to every situation and conversation I can think of.  The core reason I hold this belief is because any one gender does not inherently allow anyone to safely draw any other conclusions. I have known male-identifying gay friends and acquaintances who will often refer to each-other as she and are more comfortable with those pronouns (or at least, they appear to be;  when I asked there was a lot of good-natured teasing and very little by way of helpful education). This unreliability is, of course, far less prevalent in those that are culturally men and women (I have no idea what the gender version of \"biological male\/female\" is), but when non-binary people are thrown into the mix, as I understand it one can't really derive anything specific about how one should treat them based on just that information.  Now, if there is no reliable conclusions to be drawn from gender, does that not make it a little pointless in all conversations not about gender itself? Wouldn't it simply be better to, instead of indicating one's gender on a form, simply leave it at jotting down one's pronouns? Also, since more and more forms seem to ask for gender instead of sex, isn't something being lost there?   As I see it, your landlord doesn't necessarily need to know a nebulous facet of your cultural identity, they need to know what to call you and what kind of hygiene needs you have. I can't think of what benefit knowing your gender would provide to a tinder date, as long as they know what to call you. Meanwhile, even as a bisexual myself, I still thoroughly appreciate knowing what's between someone's legs before a date for preparation purposes.   Even if mentioning one's sex is uncomfortable, wouldn't it be better to just leave the point unaddressed rather than use gender as an unreliable substitute?  If it helps, I'm coming from the perspective of a cisgendered man who has never been very active in LGBT spaces. As such, I fully realize I'm not exactly on the forefront of understanding in this field, and generally keep my opinions to myself. This has just always bugged me a little and I thought maybe I could learn where people are coming from.  Also, fair warning: I'm not 100% on how to award Deltas, so a little patience on that front would be greatly appreciated.","__index_level_0__":14891}

Did I mention it was during a procedure to extract broken tip of dental drill from previous root canal? Honestly the entire experience has been a nightmare.   Happened in Texas .  I'm a 43 yr old Army veteran  with neuropathy in my back and legs from a terrible.back surgery and a lifetime of treating my body like a 2nd hand took box... but this was the most painful thing I've ever experienced.  I never knew what a'10' on the pain scale felt like until this.  Went in for a root canal and was told 2 hrs into a very painful and stressful experience that the drill tip they were using had broken and that the bit was still lodged into my gums. And this is *after* they finished the procedure. I was told that they'd have to go back in and start over and undo everything they'd done to this point.   I was in so much discomfort and pain plus I had to leave to pick up.my daughter from school soon...had no time to do it then and was told that I probably would never know it was there and if it bothered me to come back and they'd deal w it then.    Well,  about 3 weeks later the pain began. And got worse and worse. I called, made the appointment,  and after a prolonged exam and  way too much hedging and hand wringing the dentist admitted that it was the bit that had infected the surrounding tissue.   Now FF to the extraction date and it was at the end of the day, after hours and from jump I could tell he was NOT happy about having to do this. No hello . No \"how are you feeling \".  No pre shot numbing of injection site as he always had done before. Just GO. The shots were brutal and his technique was rough and rushed.  But we got started.     About an hour and a half in and they can't get to it. They take several sets of x-rays throughout  the proceedure but towards the end they take me to the back to do another xray. Only this one took a full 360 pan of my whole mouth so they could get a good look. When I get back to the chair he starts working again and I feel pain from the work site and I tell him (this is the 3rd time he has had to re apply novacane for the same reason ) he reaches abruptly for the needle sitting on the tray and plunges it in my open tooth and sends a searing white hot dose of lava right into the nerve.   The world went white. My ears rang. My eyes streamed w tears.  I couldn't see. I couldn't hear.  All I could do was gasp for air and then I screamed as I arched my back off of the chair. And all I could hear is him muttering under his breath: \"You don't have to hurt people... you shouldn't have to hurt people. \" He never apologized. He never asked if I was ok. He just sat there... muttering to himself until the dental assistant checked on me and wiped away 2 streams of grown man tears from my face.   After this he decided he'd had his fill of working around my tooth to get to the bit  and filed my molar down to NOTHING to get to it.  Like... the tooth is gone.  All but a shallow sliver that he intend to put a crown on. But I didn't want or need the crown.  I couldn't afford to do it after the 1st root canal and still cannot.  However he justified this by saying that tooth was going to need a crown anyway so he just \"shaved it down\".    When my wife picked me up and I got in the car, all I could do was cry.  I sobbed for the pain and the agony, of what had happened but also for the humiliation and violation of losing a piece of my body that I had paid hundreds of dollars just weeks ago to keep whole.  I was never asked if it was OK to take my tooth. He just did.   Today I experience nerve pain every time I eat.  I always feel like I had a brutal root canal 2 days ago after every meal.. Even if I'm careful.  Plus if I apply *any* pressure to the side of my face where he injected me it's as if it is happening all over again... the nerve is still white hot, and fear it always will be.

Besides this, I am a \u201cmature student\u201d and had a new baby\/ family and job obligations ( I didn\u2019t really have time to connect a lot with additional activities and networking after class), so I feel strange asking for letters of recommendation from professors that I only know through my interactions in class. I did participate in a dig and work-study, but that would only account for one letter of recommendation.  I\u2019m wondering, after graduation, how do you ask for recommendation letters from professors whom you weren\u2019t particularly close with?   I also had some complications and health issues after having my daughter, and wanted to wait until healthy again before applying to a graduate program, but now I feel uncomfortable asking for letters of recommendation.   I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s and wonder if I have passed my window ( ie. too old to be competitive for this) and or is it worth it?  I know, a lot of pondering going on here. I just can\u2019t help but wonder, looking for jobs in anthropology ( let alone paleo anthropology in the US) is less than hopeless for an individual with only a BA.   With that being said, I really love paleo anthropology and am very passionate about my research. I really can\u2019t imagine going back to a non-intellectually challenging\/ stimulating work existence without trying to get into a graduate program. I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly for these letters or if I should. Also, if I shouldn\u2019t then how to get letters for the application? Post bacc classes ( I\u2019ve taken online and feel no real connection with the professors).  Any help here would be so very grateful. Also, I\u2019m okay with harsh reality answers!

I don't think that is true. Since the election, he seems to have struggled to get anything done even with about as favourable a situation a President could have.  He's argued for healthcare changes that takes insurance away from people despite promising to do the opposite. He's gotten the US more involved in Syria despite promising the opposite. He has claimed credit for keeping jobs in the US that were never going to leave and creating jobs that were already planned. He decided the low unemployment figures were real when he won the election. He claimed to \"drain the swamp\" then gave his family important jobs. He said Obama was wrong to use executive orders then did so. He still seems to be trusted by his supporters. Likewise, when he argued that Obama wiretapped him, I thought that Trump supporters would find a way to believe him. They did.  I think that Trump could do the exact same things as Obama and effectively do no actual work but as long as he offends the left and minorities, he will retain the support of >80% of his current supporters as the media they watch and their own bias will convince them that everything is getting better and Trump is doing a great job.

I have a diagnosed mental illness (bipolar+PTSD). I grew up below the poverty line in my country, I no longer live below the poverty line.  I realise that access to healthcare is a privilege that not everyone gets (though I personally believe that it is a fundamental human right).  Okay so reasons why I don't think self diagnosis is valid: 1. It takes years and years of study and experience in the field to accurately assess and diagnose mental illnesses. 2. A diagnosis is really only beneficial if you know how to treat or manage that diagnosis. 3. Some diagnosis require medications to help manage. 4. Some mental illnesses share traits or have traits that can be easily confused. 5. Self diagnosis undermines the struggle of people with diagnosed mental health issues to be taken seriously. (Especially in school and the work place) 6. You could miss diagnose yourself and further delay proper treatment.  7. It might encourage people to self medicate which could make them worse off.

Prior to this I was in a research group for a little over a year, but in a completely different field. The second I heard back from the new group I basically had a panic attack: I felt fraudulent, like I somehow tricked them into saying yes; thoughts that I'm not smart or accomplished enough keep crossing my mind even still.   I've heard of impostor syndrome and realized that what I'm experiencing is consistent with some of the things I've heard about it; however, just recognizing that what I'm experiencing is normal doesn't help very much.

{"post_id":"kei95e","history":"NE: My sister's husband died and now his ex-girlfriend has popped up saying he has two children and she would like money for support. Posting for my sister who doesn't know how to reddit.  My sister was was with her husband for 5 years, married for 3, no children.  Before their relationship he was in a relationship with (but never married to) another woman - my sister does not know much about their relationship.  My sister's husband had a successful career and made good money, but shortly after their marriage he was diagnosed with a serious illness. He immediately went into aggressive treatment and had to stop working due to the side affects, but the treatment was unsuccessful and he never returned to work. During that time my sister supported them both. He received some money from disability insurance during this time.  He eventually passed away 10 months ago.  Prior to his death he and my sister saved a large sum of money over the course of their relationship which they used to buy a home in cash prior to his death. So - he did not leave much of anything behind and his \"will\" has already been settled.  My sister has now been informed that his ex-girlfriend has two children who she says he fathered, and she filed for child support prior to learning he is deceased. Now she says that she plans to take legal action against his estate for a share of his assets for her children.  My sister is worried about two things:     (1) She is not confident this woman is telling the truth. This is definitely a woman they dated, but he at least was never aware of having children and my sister does not believe the children look anything like him. I know this is an emotional response BUT it begs the question of proving paternity. He was cremated, my sister has nothing remaining containing his DNA, and he does not have known living relatives whose DNA can be used for comparison. How do we know if this woman is telling the truth - or if they aren't his kids and she is just trying to pull a fast one?  (2) My sister is worried about the possibility of a lawsuit. They had just purchased a home, so they had little in cash except their emergency fund. He had nothing left in his retirement fund and had a modest life insurance policy which my sister was the recipient of. Is there a scenario in which my sister has to dig into her own pockets to fund \"child support' or whatever you would call it in this scenario?  &#x200B;  For the record, my sister did have a brief consultation with a family attorney who was recommended in our area for child support matters. He told her not to worry about it until she gets legal papers, and that it's unlikely to go anywhere at this point as her husband is literally deceased. He did help her with letting the other state's child support folks know that he is deceased and sending a copy of the death certificate. He said if she receives anything from any lawyer, or anything from a child support agency, to come back and talk to him again.   She appreciates his advice and was calmed by it, but she is still nervous about this. I'm hoping instead of wasting another lawyer's time with a second opinion that may be the exact same, you all might be able to give some insight as to whether she should be concerned \/ do anything.

{"post_id":"5onox8","history":"How can I course correct my career? I graduated with an Ocean Engineering degree in 2014.  I worked for 2 years at a small engineering company before being laid off about 4 months ago. I think it was a mix of things that lead to me being laid off. I have not been able to really find any jobs in my field in Houston since that time.  There don't seem to be any job postings for positions relevant to my experience and I am afraid I will be running out of money in the next 6 months.    As far as my experience with my previous job, I felt fairly anxious from the beginning.  From the interview, the company said they were fairly intense and had high expectations and that I would be working mainly in the marine department, but also picking up slack in the structural department.  For the first 9 months things went fairly well, but then it started falling apart.  They ran out of work in the marine department from that point on and I never really did anymore meaningful work like that again which was what I went to school for and was  a major disappointment for me.  They transitioned me to the structural department and I started getting up to speed there on a few small projects.  I enjoyed the freedom to create solutions myself, but I struggled with several aspects of the job, mainly that I was slow to produce results (mainly fab and test drawings, and load reports).  Then, I got some very tedious, time consuming, and low low low priority jobs.  I honestly think they were just biding time hoping more work would come, but it never did. I tried in earnest at first to complete them, but then they just gave me more of the same.   From here, I got very depressed\/frustrated with my work.  It felt meaningless, I could never get priority on drafting rescources, and my managers would check in on me about twice a week for a few minutes top because these jobs were so low priority. I tried to bring up my concerns, but it was a fight to get anyones attention for more than 5 minutes, and I was afraid to say I was wasting my time and being unproductive.  I would get stuck often but no one would take me seriously if I asked for help, the projects were conceptually simple but logistical nightmares, so their answers were dismissive in my opinion, they would just spitball some ideas that fix one problem but created 3 more and just seemed annoyed that I was wasting more of their time.  I won't lie, it got to me and I started dreading working on these projects. I started wasting time.  I was on my phone, or browsing the web a bit, but mostly it felt like I was just staring into space hoping that something would come along and help me get through these projects. I fell behind on deadlines, made a lot of mistakes on the work that was being completed that had to be reworked or fixed later, and it all culminated in a colossal mistake that embarrassed the company although it didn't cause damage or cost too much relatively.    If i'm honest, I feel like they massively mismanaged my hiring and training process, and also that I didn't put in 100%.  All of my coworkers had masters in structural and more experience.  I would never have been hired into the role without the managers tossing me around.  There was one coworker who was exactly the same qualifications as me but a few years older, he got all of whatever work went into the marine department, and I ran support on the very limited occasions he needed it.  I could never convince anyone to make this split more fair on continue my training in that discipline to get me to the level where I could take any more of it on, I just got stuck with more structural work.  I did like many parts of my job, and I did not feel any of it was beneath me, I just felt that I wasn't suited for the structural work and that I wasn't particularly good with it.  I am at a loss as for what to do next.  I can't find a job, or even get interviews and I feel like its because my experience is this awkward hodgepodge of random things.  The oil and gas industry has been in a slump, so there arent many jobs out there anyway.  I feel like I have been working too long and that I am being passed over for entry level positions when I would be more than happy and willing to try a soft reset on my career.  I have a lot of doubt about whether my company was just a bad experience for me, because I had 1 coworker in particular who seemed to flourish in that environment and got all the marine work for himself, while I floundered.  Is it me? Was it legitimately a lack of work and just poor timing like they said in my exit interview? Am I cut out for this career, or should I try and find something else before I run out of money\/time?  Is this experience normal? My biggest fear is that I get another job and that this is just standard practice, and I am not cut out for all of this.    I guess I am just looking for reassurance, advice, other perspectives. Anything really.  I learned a lot from all this and I have been forced to really look inwards and evaluate what I need to fix, and I am willing to do it.  My family and friends have been a huge support, but getting fired really has brought up a lot of self-doubt about whether I can be a successful engineer.  I just remember being anxious from the beginning and having some success, but then it just started going wrong, and the anxiety buit and built and it became self destructive, and then I got fired, and now I just don't know how to put myself right.

{"post_id":"lpah82","history":"CMV: If a video game company is going to file lawsuits or issue DMCA takedown notices against piracy sites, it is their obligation to provide legitimate primary sources to purchase or otherwise obtain the affected titles I want to preface this by clarifying that I do not condone video game piracy. That said, I do acknowledge the argument in favor of it, especially in this context.  The video game piracy debate is nothing new, and a cursory glance at this sub will tell you that there are those who fall on both sides of the spectrum on this topic. It's not my intention to delve too deeply into the morality of video game piracy with this post, but rather to address accountability of the companies producing the games.  To expand on the title, a sizeable amount of video game piracy centers around games which are, for one reason or another, not readily available to the mass market. These generally tend to include games which saw a physical release long enough ago that they are no longer available through primary distribution. If you didn't have the opportunity to purchase one of these games during that release window then there are essentially two options available if you wish to play it: Either purchase the game secondhand, or pirate it. Obviously one of these is the more morally questionable choice, but the common thread between the two is that either way, no money is going to the game developers at this point.  Now for where the main issues come into play. Obviously game companies want to protect their IPs, so when piracy sites begin sharing those games for free, the best course of action seems like it would be to take them down. However, in many cases this has the additional effect of cutting off access for new players to experience these games.  A great example I want to ~~pick on~~ focus on is Nintendo, a company that is notorious for issuing DMCA takedown notices when piracy websites come into play. At the same time, however, for the majority of the affected titles Nintendo has refused to provide a legal, accessible, and most importantly *primary* source to purchase them. Don't get me wrong, things like used game stores are great, but a lot of places, particularly countries that never saw a formal release of those games, have limited access to and supply of them. In addition their copies of games tend to be a bit worse for wear, with no quality guarantee, plus the game company doesn't profit off of them, which...isn't that a big part of why they come down on piracy sites? Because someone else is profiting off of their IP? I dunno, that last bit went on a bit of a tangent.  I will acknowledge the good that releasing products like the NES and SNES Classic did, plus the access we have to classic games through Nintendo Switch Online, but the currently available 72 NES games and 42 SNES games are just a drop in the bucket compared to the **1433** games that were produced between them. That's a mere **8%** of a massive game library available in modern format, and those are just the first two consoles. The Game Boy Advance, Nintendo's third highest selling console of all time, handheld or otherwise, is historically the most popular category for video game piracy websites. The console boasts a library of 1498 games, and 74 of these games are currently available for purchase via Nintendo Virtual Console (which at the time of making this post is the only first party way I am aware of to obtain a majority of GBA games), giving us an even more pathetic 5% of availability. The best part? When comparing this list of available games to the top 40 best-selling GBA games of all time, how many do you think made the cut? Surely Nintendo would at least want to capitalize on the popularity of one of their best selling handheld consoles, right? Well that number comes to...16 games. So not only did we get laughable representation of the library, but barely a fifth of this number represent the games players are most likely to seek out, enjoy, and most importantly in this argument's case, pirate.  Numbers, percentages and Nintendo-shaming aside, what am I getting at here? While piracy sites show there is clearly a demand for these older games, many game developers seem to stubbornly deny a way for players to gain access to them. That or the way they go about it is temporary and convoluted (Looking at you 3D All-Stars.) If a video game company is going to cut off the only access many younger users have to these games, legal or otherwise, the absolute, most basic courtesy they could show would be to make them available in a modern format. Digital downloads, game streaming services, it doesn't matter how you do it guys, most people will be willing to pay you if it means having an easy way to play your games without worrying about the legal ramifications.","__index_level_0__":15603}

{"post_id":"4o8ksj","history":"[Humanities] How deep down the rabbit hole before you can say you know what you're doing? Background: Did a BA in a terrible uni (did not learn anything there), ended up in an MA in Japan with little to no knowledge about anything. Spent the past 2 years dedicating my life to catching up (but impostor syndome is always strong...)   So It's about time I finish my dissertation, and I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Mainly, I'm not sure I'm qualified to be writing this.   Background about Japan: They read&publish *a lot*. Stephen king would be considered lazy in this country. It's the kind of country where people who say that they don't read still read hundreds of titles, where even minor issues have dozens of books written about it, and most major academics have 30+ books to their name, most of them in response to other 30-book academics in a manner in which you don't get it unless you've read all of them.   My dissertation is basically a Japanese author, Japanese subculture theory, and queer theory.  On a personal level, I think I'm pretty solid; I've read a lot about and by my author (though she's published 50 titles so by no means all), I think I get her, I can definitely see the patterns, etc. Been reading theory like mad these past 2 years, by now I'm pretty solid about understanding it, perhaps not so much in writing it. But delving into the Japanese part is giving me serious impostor syndrome.   Basically, all the papers about my author tend to revolve around the same things. They're pretty much intertwined, with very little contradictions; I agree with most interpretations and definitely feel them. But I feel inadequate in taking on the Japanese theory since, well, my life is too short to read all of it. I like reading the theory, I feel that I understand it quite well, but it references many thousand-page series, academic squabbles drawn out over dozens of books, and so on. I'm a fast reader, but the literary background would be a solid 10 years worth of reading, and that's not counting the things that are published in the meantime. then there's Japanese literary theory&history which is, again, a quagmire. Most of them have nothing to do with what I'm writing about, but I feel like an impostor for relying on it superficially. It's made worse by the fact that I often read foreigners writing superficially about Japan, and I definitely feel like I'm being judged for writing about Japanese lit when I'm not insanely well-read (nor Japanese).   TL;DR: as a rule of thumb, where is a point where you can stop and say 'ok, I've read enough to have a good grasp of things'? I think that most academic matters have a rabbit hole that you can go down in and grow old before you can see the end of it; at what point can you feel content?","__index_level_0__":992}

{"post_id":"bpgm51","history":"What are alternative career paths for a recent engineering graduate who's effectively unhireable as an engineer? Hola, amigos!  I just graduated from a top ten university with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Sounds great, right? Well...I graduated with a 2.21 gpa (2.43 major). Zero internship experience. Spent most of my semesters on academic probation. Took 6.5 years to graduate.  To be blunt, I'm not hireable. No company in the world could look at my academic record and choose to give me a shot. I know that, and I recognize that engineering simply isn't an option for me at this point.  With that said, what *are* the options for someone like me? I don't want to work a minimum-wage job the rest of my life, like I have been full-time since graduating, and I have to believe it's possible to find some job somewhere that I could be qualified for. Or become qualified for.  What should someone in a situation like mine do?*  I appreciate any and all insight.  *I don't want to make this question specific to me, but rather broadly applicable to anyone whose undergraduate experience was, to put it mildly, an unmitigated disaster. I'm happy to answer questions about my specific situation, but I want to keep the situation generalizable for everyone.   **Addendum:** I don't want to portray myself as completely hopeless. Yes, my overall gpa is dire, but the context is that I \"earned\" a 1.42 gpa during my freshman year, and subsequently took two years off to take community college courses before returning. With the exception of a semester that proved to be almost a total loss (1.37 gpa and two D's; I should have dropped out of classes before the deadline), I earned a 2.44 gpa or higher in my other 5 semesters, and a 2.82 and 3.20 in my final two semesters, respectively (while working 20+ hours per week during both semesters). So it's not a complete wash. But it's very hard to be optimistic... I have a friend who enjoyed a full ride, earned a 3.95 gpa, and worked multiple internships...and he applied to 60 jobs, with only 2 interviews!","__index_level_0__":7559}

In the battle Killmonger was clearly the superior warrior and defeated T'Challa, but because of interference from Zuri to save T'Challa's life, Killmonger wasn't able to deliver the killing blow. Further, when T'Challa was thrown off the waterfall, M'Baku of the Jabari tribe interfered to keep him alive. Both of these should have disqualified T'Challa. When T'Challa mortally wounds Killmonger later, it's with the Black Panther herb as well as the Black Panther suit, as that's not the legitimate ritual combat.  _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

{"post_id":"mf2gmx","history":"CMV: People should stop using the term \"sus\", when describing something\/someone acting apparently gay. This seems to be a new trend. I'm not a native English speaker so I've only seen\/heard it online, but in essence the term is used like \"bro that was sus as fuck\" \"haha that sounded sus\" \"he was acting sus all night\" etc etc. Basically, if someone (generally a guy) does or says something that makes them \"seem gay\" in any way, you call them sus, short for suspect\/suspicious.  I think this is not only homophobic but also bad in other ways. First off, it implies that being gay is something bad\/shameful\/undesirable. The term has generally negative connotations - \"suspect\" means someone is shady, maybe even dangerous. Being suspicious of someone means you don't know if you can trust them, whether they're hiding something or not. In other situations you would be suspicious of an employee that you think is stealing from your business, or of your partner that you think might be cheating. Accusing someone of being \"sus\" in the viral game Among Us means you think that person is the \"bad guy\"\/murderer. So by saying that someone is \"sus\" for \"acting gay\", it implies being gay is something negative.  Then there is also the part of it that's reinforcing toxic stereotypes. For example if two of your male friends hug each other and you say \"yo that was a bit sus\" as a joke then it reinforces the idea that men should not show emotions or affection. Which is a pretty harmful idea that can lead to men not talking about their problems\/emotions and can ultimately be a factor in men's mental problems and suicide rates.  But I think the main problem I have with the phrase is the homophobic part, and it's very similar to the phrase \"no homo\" which I also think is inherently homophobic.

{"post_id":"i7fbip","history":"CMV: If your first and immediate response to equality between genders is, \"so that means men can hit women,\" then you're probably sexist! I'll preface with this: yes, gender equality would mean treating genders equally, so men shouldn't view women as weaker or treat them differently because of gender. So yeah, the whole \"you shouldn't fight a girl because she's a girl\" logic is inherently sexist. So I don't disagree with the fact that gender equality means throwing that whole idea out.  &#x200B;  However...  &#x200B;  If your very first thought is to use gender equality as a justification for violence against women, you're most likely misogynistic, or maybe you're just trying to crack a really annoying overused joke, idk. When I think of feminism, I think of equality in opportunities - in the eyes of the law, in healthcare, in sports, in the job market, in education, in STEM fields and so on; my very first thought isn't \"oOo so that means men should be allowed to hit girls!\" Like why are your thoughts on feminism immediately connected to what men can do because of feminism? Why is your first instinct violence against women instead of considering how much more positive women's lives can be as gender equality improves? Why is feminism seen as a justification for doing more wrong?   &#x200B;  Feminism should focus on lifting women up so that they are on equal footing as men and get the same treatment and opportunities as men get. So why are you immediately resorting to the new opportunities men can get as feminism develops? Also, yes you can theoretically fight women like you would men, but I feel like with the men who don't understand feminism well, they're going to take this as \"I'm allowed to hit women\" when in reality the notion should only apply to situations like fighting in self-defense. Some people are definitely going to take gender equality as \"men are \\*allowed\\* to fight women\" instead of \"men should not be held back from violence against any gender if they are in a situation of self-defense or where violence is necessary.\"   &#x200B;  Again, I agree that saying things like \"I don't fight women,\" \"I can't hit her because she's a girl,\" etc. are sexist; they are. But, if the first thing you think of when you think of gender equality is hitting women, out of all things that could change because of feminism...you got problems.  &#x200B;  Sorry in advance if any explanation was unclear, I kinda suck at writing out arguments.

{"post_id":"3ju7qq","history":"CMV: Ethics\/Philosophy should be considered as important of an elective as Fine Arts or Physical Education etc. in high school Schools around the world obviously have varying systems, but by the time students reach high school, they usually have some degree of freedom over what classes they may take. The context of this CMV is in high schools because they often need to make decisions on what kind of elective courses to offer, if any at all.   Classes that are considered electives will often be optional to take at most schools, or if are required, have less hours of classtime when compared to more 'core' classes such as math, or English\/native language. As a result, people will usually select electives that best fit their interests and whatever they need for graduation, or whatever they consider to be an easy course. There are other reasons, but I think those three are the major ones.  When I say ethics\/philosophy, I do not mean in the sense of pushing religious dogma or nihilism or any one specific set of beliefs, but a more broad survey-type course. I think that it's valuable to be able to examine one set of ideologies or philosophies in detail, but have trouble thinking of a practical means to keep them objective right now.  With this is mind, this is why I believe that Ethics\/Philosophy type courses should be as consistently available in high schools as in other electives: They offer a way of understanding the world in a time where the mind is still developing and beginning to struggle with existential questions, and also allow for students to make better decisions in their lives.   When comparing these types of courses to others, such as music, art, or physical education, it is clear that many of these don't have much immediate practical value. I would actually say that the ability to gain a more broad worldview and at least a basic formation of some sort of internal moral code could be more valuable in the present day than being able to run quickly, although there are benefits to both. In many instances, having such an exposure would be of large benefit to people.  In terms of practicality, I think that designing a course tailored for high school students is challenging, but not impossibly difficult. Books tailored for teenagers have been written in this genre (Sophie's World comes to mind), and connections can be drawn from text\/concepts to the real world. Finding teachers to teach such a subject competently probably wouldn't be hard, either. Many teachers in the general 'humanities' field have some background in this, and I would guess that a decent number of them would be interested and willing to share this interest with others. Compared to other electives, which may require money for instruments, or art supplies or similar things, it's not really that expensive, either.  One danger is that this kind of course can be taught poorly, and that some of the effectiveness of it may be lost on students. However, we take this risk with subjects such as math all the time, with students oftentimes turned away because of a teacher that is unable to clearly explain subjects. Even if the precedents in this are ignored, I think that simple exposure, even if incomplete, will still bring more benefits than harm.     _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

{"post_id":"wpzu8u","history":"CMV: Religious mission trips do more harm than good From what I've read online about them, the two main purposes of mission trips seem to be 1) to spread their religion and 2) to do physical service work.  I find the first purpose to be really insulting to the people of the countries missionaries travel to. It sends a message that these people cannot possibly choose the best religious beliefs (or lack thereof) for themselves and need the \"help\" of missionaries to follow the \"right\" religion. These trips almost always take place in impoverished areas of the world and to me it feels like the \"saying the quiet part out loud\" in this situation would be to say that the people who go on these trips believe that poor people are stupid and easy to prey on. The source I read (linked in the first paragraph) specifically says \"many of the countries most in need of the gospel are also full of poverty, and places filled with poverty are also filled with vulnerable people\". It seems that they mean that these people are easier to convert because they are often in crisis situations and are desperate. Some go so far as to go on these trips to build a church rather than something that the community needs.  I believe that the second reason people go on these trips, physical service work, is also problematic. While the source says that you *sometimes* need medical training or degrees to do medical mission trips, it also talks about trips focusing on construction and education which you do *not* need training or degrees in. Most of the people who go on these trips are under 25 years old. It is very unlikely at these ages that they have the skills necessary to perform these tasks which means that they are potentially building unsafe structures and improperly teaching children. I also believe this is bad because it takes work away from the locals and costs more money. Rather than paying to fly yourself out there, paying for housing and meals, and using a community's resources, why not just donate money so that local people can do the work? Would it not make more sense to pay for the supplies so that a local contractor can build a school or pay for a local person's education so that they can become a teacher rather than untrained college aged people doing this work? Without paying for your own expenses, you'd have more money to give as well.  To me, it seems like these trips serve the people who go on them more than the people they say they want to help. They provide experiences for the travelers, but little to no help for people in poverty and\/or crisis situations.","__index_level_0__":14775}

He's been dumping his trailer and other stuff over her property line for years, despite her asking him to keep off her property.  She had the land surveyed a few years ago so she knows he is on her property.  Last year she put up wooden stakes with rope along the property line and jerk neighbour pulls them out of the ground and throws them onto her property.  She's in her 80's and lives alone.  Bylaw has been called after that incident and they spoke with the neighbour but things have only gotten worse.    The neighbour has been digging during the night, a septic tank hole which is deep and about 20 feet into her property.  My husband went out with a professional surveyor today to find out where exactly the property lines are and now it is clearly marked, with this big hole in Grandma's yard.  We already have someone lined up to fill in the hole but we are concerned about the liability issue since it's on her property.    We are building a fence in the coming weeks along the property line.  When he first started digging, Grandma decided it was time to build a fence to hopefully end this.  What we didn't know before the surveyor came out was why he was digging this hole - there's pipes in it and it is for a septic bed.  We assume he had no permits since he did it during the nights and not during the day so my Grandma is going to Town Hall to speak with someone there about this.  Is there anything else she should be doing though? I think they are giving the neighbour notice to get his pipes out ASAP as we are filling in the hole this week - do we even need to tell him?    Sorry if this is rambly, I just worry about my Grandma and her jerk neighbour and what else he might try to do.  He won't be happy once the fence is built as he loses his waterfront, but at this point he's clearly aware what he is doing is wrong and he continues to do things on her property.","__index_level_0__":18137}
{"post_id":"upvkbr","history":"CMV: Spectators of a livestream who join with intent to watch massacre should be prosecuted I have a view that I feel in the wake of the shooting that I think makes sense, but am willing to have my mind changed. I read somewhere that the shooter was scoping his targets for up to twenty minutes before finally shooting, with at least 20 spectators in the livestream. I don't know if this is true and the CMV does not deal with the facts of this particular massacre, rather it deals with the general case where an illegal act is livestreamed with actual spectators in the platform  I believe the following:   Assuming there were spectators to a livestream that recorded illegal acts like mass shootings or lynchings:  1. Law enforcement should be empowered to subpoena the website hosting the livestream to compel the website\/platform to provide data relating to the livestream (IP Addresses, date of the livestream and any other identifying information about the author of the livestream ***as well as the spectators***) 2. There should be a **severe** legal penalty if it can be proven, as a result of this subpoena, for people who watched a livestream with full knowledge of what was to transpire who did not a good faith attempt to inform law enforcement (where someone's digital footprint demonstrates that they knew of the plans of the attack, encouraged it and did not act upon that information). 3. I do not know if there is a law that deals specifically with spectators. If there is such a law, I believe that that law should be modified to further increase the penalties whatever those penalties currently are  For the purpose of this CMV, I am defining spectator as those who *(1) watch a livestream of an illegal act, such as a massacre or assault, (2) who had prior knowledge that such an act would be committed and (3) made no good faith attempt to contact law enforcement.*   I tried Googling about the legalities of watching \"illegal livestreams\" but all I got were articles about watching illegally obtained copyright materials. The only article I could find was this which deals specifically with California, citing failure to report a crime as a misdemeanor. This is ***INADEQUATE*** and **my CMV calls for something more punitive and expansive such as a federal statute with penalties requiring more than 10 years incarceration and penalties much higher than $1000.**  I am willing to have my view changed and considered the following counterpoints:   **Privacy**  However, I think if we were to transpose the digital situation into a real life situation, I think people who were physically present who went out of there way to watch an illegal commission of an act with knowledge beforehand that the act was going to transpire, I think law enforcement is empowered to prosecute those spectators. Similarly, if an IP Address or other digital foot print can be linked to a person who entered a livestream with the intent to an illegal act, they should be similarly prosecuted.  This would require that companies provide more information about the user: their login and chat history. But I feel that punishing those who watch massacres as entertainment would be a net benefit for society. And the subpoena power would be scoped to just that livestream and the information of the users who view that livestream.  **Is it reasonable to expect platforms to provide this information?**  I think it is. Platforms should provide whatever they have. My CMV does not compel platforms to acquire information about users: just that they provide whatever they have upon receiving a subpoena which is again scoped to that specific livestream and the relevant meta data of the users.  Even if it were the case that most of the spectators use technologies or methods to obfuscate their identity or digital footprint, I still think it would be a social good to compel platforms to provide whatever they have about the spectators of the livestream. Hopefully at least one or a few spectators can be punished. Shaming the few we can catch will be a net good for society and hopefully their pathology can be better understood.   **If you don't know what the penalties are, why increase them?**  I think increasing the penalties (if they don't exist for spectators of these livestreams) should be increased to send a message. People who view these livestreams need to be made an example of to break the sick dynamic where murderers perform their illegal acts for posterity or for status\u2014any community that has a member who makes a credible threat of violence should understand that if the act were to transpire, law enforcement, the media and the American people will descend upon them and find perpetrators and abettors to crimes.   I would be willing to change my mind on this specific point if 1. there is already a law addressing spectators AND the law is so punitive that a convincing case can be made that increasing the penalties will do little to deter the act itself or the desire to watch it unfold.   **How punitive is too punitive? Your calls for punishment is not proportional to the act which is merely spectating a crime**  I think in light of the social dynamics of these massacres, we need to rethink the seriousness of \"just spectating\" a livestream of a massacre (again, with full knowledge that a massacre is or is about to unfold). Misdemeanor levels of punishment is inadequate. We have specific laws for educators and professionals who are mandated reports\u2014similarly, in a digital, distributed world, it is fair to empower all citizens to be mandated reporters of heinous crimes within their communities and platforms. Most will not report\u2014my CMV calls for empowering law enforcement and our statutes to forcibly compel platforms to provide metadata and punish spectators as well as the perpetrator. Increasing the punishment will provide a net beneficial value to society by letting users know that by even watching a massacre, law enforcement will have the legal tools to find and identify you.   **Would your view include those who did make a good faith attempt but for whatever reason cannot provide evidence that they made an attempt to contact law enforcement?**  This is one of the more difficult parts of my view. I think those people should not be prosecuted. But even if my view results in very few cases where people can be convicted, I think it is a good standard to set on principle\u2014if the various elements of a spectator with prior knowledge and further evidence that no good faith attempt was made, we need to increase those penalties, even if it is very hard to prove all of these facts.  Again, these are just my initial feelings upon hearing the news today about Buffalo. A small part of me feels that my view may be ill considered in the long term but I would like to understand why. Right now, I feel empowering the state to go after spectators is incredibly important.","__index_level_0__":15575}

{"post_id":"hete4e","history":"1st Year PhD - Removed From Project Until recently I was a 1st year PhD student working on my project. However, I was dismissed following my viva under the guise of \"poor writing\" in a continuation report for transfer into the 2nd year. Initially shocked at this sudden change from my supervisor, as we meet weekly to touch base and my writing ability has never been raised as a concern. Going back through the assessors feedback comments from the initial draft, it was generally positive or constructive. i.e make figure x larger, move paragraph y above z. Overall, the report and oral viva were praised for well thought out discussions, sound methodology, good results and clear progression\/future plans (all documented) with just a vague \"introduction is poorly written\". However, when pressed the assessor could not\/would not expand on this, dismissing me with \"its all poor\" contrary to the feedback he himself had provided! I was told my only options at this stage are to \"withdraw from your course, or submit an MPhil but I will not accept it\". Thus I am appealing this verdict.  After speaking with various staff and peers it has become obviously clear to everyone who has heard the situation that you would not remove someone for poor writing, if that is indeed the case. Institutional guidelines recommend to advise relevant training, workshops, exercises and teaching to address a students weaknesses. I believe this serves as wrongful dismissal\/ not adhering to due process of the university. So I've raised this further to the senior staff.  It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it's doubtful I'll get my previous post\/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn't be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab\/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around\/appealing so wouldn't give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I've kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised. At its core it began as a wrongful dismissal and academic appeal, but the more I look into it, ask around and hear from others experiences with the lab. There's documented evidence of abuse of power, discrimination, harassment\/bullying among other serious allegations that the university HAS known about ...but have just brushed  under the rug because they bring in too much money!

Should they both be done away with? Also yes! But that isn\u2019t the point of my view on these things.   If a woman assumes a man is going to pay for the first date, that\u2019s usually because for hundreds of years society has been structured so that only men really get to earn a living, women are just tag alongs. Social inertia means that even if the original condition in which a behavior arose is removed, the behavior will continue for some time.   If a man assumes a woman will take his name after marriage, the same socio-cultural factors come into play as with the first date assumptions, namely that women were add ons to a man\u2019s existence.   So Change My View that it\u2019s no more offensive for a woman to expect a man to pay for their first date than it is for a man to expect a woman to take his name  (Note: my viewpoint is that the marriage assumption is AT LEAST as offensive as the date one.

I coped with it by assuming that all mass-having components of such a body would pull an object directly toward it causing both the top and bottom of the body to be pulling at an angle to it's center of mass, partly canceling out. This seems to suggest that gravity is stronger the lesser the body's volume. It also seems to suggest that as you get closer to the body, the extremities would pull less strongly causing a small reduction as the angle increases (not enough to overcome the inverse relationship to distance of the equation perhaps).   The equation for the force of gravity only seems to take mass, displacement, and the gravitational constant into account.

{"post_id":"rt0p2v","history":"CMV: The shift from \"Art\" to \"Content Creation\" is degrading the artistic quality of creative works, and will continue to for the foreseeable future (Fresh topic) Hey all, this one is mostly for fun, but I do think a lot about how the internet and content consumption has an effect on creatives around the world. Definitely open to changing my view and also hearing different perspectives.  In recent decades, social media, YouTube and other internet platforms have become the main places many people go to consume media and spend their free time. This obviously has had a huge impact on creatives, and we see a huge number of aspiring \"Content Creators\" and less aspiring \"Artists.\" In my argument, I'm using Artist as a blanket statement to include anyone who makes creative works. Musicians, authors, poets, visual artists, filmmakers, etc.  ***Artistic quality*** is something that is obviously subjective and up for debate, but I think many kinds of content are blatantly non-artistic, and it would be hard to argue that they are. Examples: Let's Play Youtube channels, reaction channels, Instagram and Snapchat influencers, many many subreddits, the vast majority of TikTok videos, many podcasts, etc. While I am open to debating what is of artistic value, I would say works that qualify as artistic and having lasting quality have some qualifications:  \\- The act of creating, and the work itself is emotionally expressive for the creator. It also is typically seen as an artistic, self-expressive act by the creator.  \\- The work provokes an emotional, meaningful, or thought provoking response in those engaging with it.  \\- It has a lasting cultural effect or meaningful impact on society.  \\- It is, well... creating something that wasn't there before! Someone making ***anything*** that expresses their inner world, to me, is inherently more artistic than a video of you doing squats at the gym.  It's obvious to see that these platforms function in an inherently different way than all other creative or artistic platforms in human history, and thus effect the artistic works made for the platforms. All social media websites are driven on user engagement, with the algorithms that drive these websites solely focused on ***keeping users on their platform as long as possible.*** This by itself is going to change the nature of the media made for these platforms - users are no longer rewarded for creating works that have higher ***quality,*** or have a thought provoking or lasting effect on society, they are only rewarded for creating works that are immediately eye catching, or keep users engaged for this exact moment, only to be forgotten about seconds later quite often. Obviously this feedback loop will lead to people who shape their lives around creating content for these platforms, and will make works that lead to user engagement.   Does this change in mentality, the change to a \"Content Creator\" lead to less artistically valuable works being made on the whole? I think, in general, it does. Many platforms incentivize creators to constantly be pushing out new content, and I think this is antithetical to the quiet contemplation many artistic works require. I think many people who might have opted to be an author before YouTube became huge might choose now to make a film analysis channel, or something similar, due to the instant feedback and ability to reach more people, as opposed to spending months or years doing research and writing a novel alone. There are more people opting into a less artistic platform, and making less quality creations as a result. There is also much less of a focus on originality and\/or artistry, and more of a focus on entertainment  Things to address about my argument and things that will change my view:  \\- I hope this isn't coming off as pretentious - I don't think these platforms are bad for ***society*** or anything like that, they are just bad for ***artistic creation!***  \\- If you can prove that on the whole, there are more quality creative works being made now than there were previously. I mean heck, maybe only 3% of all YouTube channels are actually of artistic quality, but maybe that's more than there used to be during the hayday of Television, Radio and film. (Please link your artistically pleasing sources here!)  \\- If you can change my mind on what criteria is important when determining artistic value - I'm open to having my view changed on this, have fun with it!  \\- If you can show me other platforms or other avenues that creators are disseminating their original artistic works, and are incentivized on originality. Bandcamp is a good example.  \\- If you can argue that in the future, it won't always be this way, and that while at the moment this is the effect that algorithms are having on content creation, that for some reason it will actually have a ***positive*** impact on artistic value, eventually.","__index_level_0__":16093}

This is inspired by the Serious Eats reverse sear method of cooking prime rib:  I have a 4.6lb boneless prime rib roast (chuck end, I believe). Last night I rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and it's been sitting uncovered in the refrigerator overnight. I intend to reverse sear it, first low and slow at 235F for 4-6 hours (or whatever it takes to get to 132F), rest it for 20-30m, then blast it at 500F for 5-10 minutes (or whatever it takes to crust it. I've done this method in the past without tenting, and I was very happy with the results.  But while rubbing with SPGp, a bunch fell off into the pan. Of course that'll burn if left dry in the pan. So I though about adding beef broth for the low and slow part of the cook. Then I thought about tenting it to keep the liquid from evaporating too quickly.  I'm thinking the tenting might give me additional flavor in the jus, and maybe make the roast more fall-apart juicy and tender.  At the end of the slow cook, I'd remove the roast from the oven to rest for 20-30m. I'd strain off the pan juices (if any) and mix with the deli-provided au jus. Then I'd blast at 500F, carve and serve.  I have questions:  * Am I thinking right about getting better results by tenting and essentially 'steaming' it? * How will steaming affect the duration of the cook? It should go much quicker, right? * How will the 'steaming' affect the final crusting? Will I be able to achieve that crust at the end? * I'm wondering if removing the tent part-way through to pour off the juices, remove the roast from the oven, taking the time to empty the pan and wipe it out, then putting the roast back in to finish the slow part of the cook is a wrong move that could cause the meat to toughen. Should I do this at the very end? Or earlier than that to dry the crust a bit? Am I overthinking this? * I'd like to add rosemary and thyme to the crust, but of course they'll burn at the end. When is a good time to rub with herbs? Beginning? Early? Late? Never? It's too late to do it last night. * I heard of somebody also rubbing with brown sugar to help the crust, is this a thing? Should I? * Is there anything that I'm not thinking about?  Any advice that improves this is very much appreciated.

{"post_id":"btpo4h","history":"CMV: We only think Tupac and Biggie were the best rappers of all time because they died so young My argument is basically that Tupac and Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.) are only thought of as the GOATs because of the aura surrounding them. They are thought of as almost beyond reproach because they died so young and had the famous rap feud.  If Nas died after *It Was Written* he would be considered the GOAT. If Eminem died after *The Marshall Mathers LP* or *The Eminem Show* he would be definitively considered the GOAT. If Kanye died after *Graduation* or *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* he would be considered the GOAT.  Alternatively, If Nas and Jay-Z both died during their famous rap feud, they would be elevated similar to Pac and Big. Same could be said for 50 and Ja Rule.  I could go on all day, but my point is that because these artists kept putting out music (some of which has been considered lackluster), they damaged their reputation as the GOAT in a way Tupac and Big never really had a chance to do. Arguably, Tupac came close to damaging his reputation with all his posthumous releases, but, more people would need to know about his posthumous releases for it to have a significant impact.  Furthermore, the rap feuds bring in more outside attention from the entertainment world. Thus the layman is able to identify Pac and Big as the GOATs because they are simply the most recognizable\/most well known rappers of all time not necessarily the best.  If Mac Miller didn\u2019t make as much frat rap\/corny music coming up, he might in the conversation right now. You see the GOAT label unironically placed on XxXtentacion by his fans, although I\u2019m prepared to admit that is a vocal minority.  In reality Tupac and Big were NOT significantly more talented than others of that era\u2014A Tribe Called Quest, The Fugees, NWA and its members, Snoop, Nas, Big Daddy Kane, Eric B and Rakim, OutKast, Jay-Z and Wu Tang are all arguably just as talented and that\u2019s only scratching the surface. Biggie had an amazing style and crazy flows, Pac had grit and passion. They were both great writers. But are they the greatest of all time? I\u2019d say no and I\u2019d argue they are only thought of as such because they died so young and had a famous rap beef. CMV","__index_level_0__":16036}

Considering that the attack on the homestead was meant to look like being the work of the Tusken, who neither own nor use flamethrowers and especially not disintegrators, and we don't see both kind of weapons in the Sandtroopers arsenal for this mission, the most likely weapon that caused the condition of Owen and Beru's corpses are blasters.  Blasters were shown to be able to turn people into charred corpses a short time later in ANH, when we see Han shoot Greedo in the Mos Eisley cantina. Perhaps another reason for this scene, beside giving him a reason to travel with Obi Wan and Luke to Alderaan.  And why would Sandtroopers, trying to imitate a Tusken raid, give their victims a funeral? We never seen or heard about them doing this anywhere.   And simply burning along with the homestead also doesn't make sense, because the corpses lay outside and not in one of the destroyed rooms of the moisture farm.

{"post_id":"z32qlz","history":"CMV: Telling random people to smile is rude and inconsiderate of their feelings My view is that when people tell others to smile it's often comes from a place of selfishness rather than wanting that person to express themselves how they see fit. People want to see others smile mainly for aesthetic purposes than anything else. When you see someone down the street you have absolutely no idea what trials & tribulations they've faced, their life story, what they are currently going through and so on. So I think it's extremely dismissive to tell someone to put on a mask which is a smile because it personally looks appealing to you rather than actually try to brighten that persons day in any other regards. Like imagine if something tragic just happened to you where you lost your job, a love one got into a car accident or something in which it negatively impacted you. How would you feel if someone randomly came up and told you \"smile!\". Me personally it would piss me off quite a bit.  And on top of that nobody owes anyone anything when it comes to facial expression. How one chooses to express their face has no impact on anyone else's well being. Peoples faces aren't here to make someone else feel better so I feel like telling someone how they should handle their facial expression isn't any different than telling them how they should dress, walk etc. in my opinion telling people to smile comes from a form a narcissism in a sense that you want others to express themselves just for your own personal benefit. Because you find someone smiling more aesthetically pleasing than someone who doesn't look happy. Well what do you guys think?","__index_level_0__":15945}

Israel Palestine is too small, Jerusalem is too important and Palestinian territories aren't even contiguous.   I know many Palestinians want all European Jews to leave Palestine, but this isn't realistic and would require really bad ethnic cleansing. North African countries ethnically cleansed the European settlers there in the mid 20th century and their economies still haven't recovered.

{"post_id":"wkgljt","history":"Would a solar panel that is not connected to a load have a lower surface temperature than one that is providing load because of conservation of energy? I know this sounds a bit like a homework problem, but it was a discussion I was having with my boss today.  We were considering what happens to a solar PV array when it is providing load and if the load has a cooling effect on the panel surface. I framed this as a thought problem:  Imagine you had two identical closed systems each containing a solar PV array. One was connected to a resistance heater and one was connected to nothing. Each system receives the same amount of solar radiation so energy input is the same. Since heat input is the same, both systems should reach the same equilibrium temperature. However, for this to happen in the system running a resistance heater, the only reasonable explanation we could come up with is that the inactive array's surface temp is actually lower than the one that is powering the resistance heater.  Are we both missing something here? Does a working solar panel that is serving a load reduce the temperature of the panel surface?","__index_level_0__":8699}

They're the perfect keto food! I love to just get different seasonings, like some Tandoori seasoning, Lemon-Garlic seasoning, etc, and rub each thigh down.

This *should* be one of those incredibly simple recipes where you just leave and come back in an hour, but I've been having a problem. So much water comes out of the thighs that when I come back even after about a half hour, the cast-iron pan is half-way full of liquid.  I should note that I usually put as many thighs as possible in the cast iron pan (17 inch), which usually ends up being about a dozen.   Am I doing something wrong, like baking at too low of a temperature? Are the thighs I'm purchasing shitty, and have too high of a water percentage? Am I just putting too many thighs in at once?  I cook this way because I don't have much free time to cook during the week, and I like to store and eat them over the course of the week.  I was wondering what you guys thought!

Statistically most Americans support things like higher minimum wages, ending citizens united, a more socialized healthcare system, electoral reform, and an end to outsourcing and free trade agreements. However instead of focusing on these areas of common ground most politics and political movements focus on issues that are both widely divisive and much smaller in scope such as abortion, gun control, which bathrooms people should be allowed to use, and how different groups are represented in the media.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  The result of this is that people continue to be politically divided in spite of the large degree of common ground many of us have politically. By contrast an agenda of political and economic populism could both unite people and lead to real progress for many.

In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.

Furthermore, in America not only is healthcare not free, but it\u2019s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment as they have deals to use certain medications, which means their recommendations cannot be viewed as unbiased.

Therefore, eating eggs from a privately owned chicken, eating honey, and using wool should be considered vegan. Full disclosure, I am not vegan, but respect and support vegans. I am not here to bash vegans or veganism, only to discuss what I think should be considered vegan.  As far as I understand it, veganism as a lifestyle (not just as a diet) is about reducing harm to and not participating in the exploitation of animals. Obviously everyone has their own way of living a vegan life and veganism means something different to everyone, but in my opinion, there are certain ethical ways to use resources from animals.  * EGGS    * Hens lay eggs whether they're fertilized or not, so if someone owned a hen or two and ate the eggs that they were going to lay anyway, they are just making sure that those eggs aren't going to waste. This is different from buying eggs from a company that practices factory farming and has chickens for the sole purpose of profit, which would not be ethical. * HONEY    * Similarly, bees make honey whether or not anyone is there to harvest it, and they make more than they could possibly ever use. Taking the excess is, as I understand it, actually beneficial to the bees. In addition, beekeeping can be seen as a form of conservation, as bees are endangered, which I think is ethical. * WOOL    * Domesticated sheep need to be sheared regularly. As shearing is just a haircut for the sheep, it is not harming the animals or exploiting them.

{"post_id":"eur94u","history":"What killed my(30M) nephew(19M)? Hey everyone!  As the title said, my nephew died unexpectedly 16 days ago, and we have no idea how. We are still waiting for the autopsy report, but our family is obviously grieving and the uncertainty is killing us. Therefore im turning to you, in order order for, even if it's very little, information. I will do my best in explaining the whole situation. Im also an CRNA and therefore have some medical knowledge.   My nephew was a typical teenager. Just finished high school, didn't have a job yet. Was up all night gaming and sleeping all day. Had alot of friends, was a very kind-hearted person. Had no known medical issues apart from being born pre-mature and having ADD. According to his little sister and some friends, after the incident, he occasionally took Lyrica as recreational drug use, but very certain that there was no other drugs.   The night he died he hung out with two friends. The friend suspected that he had taken Lyrica before arriving at their place, but that he got more normal as the night progressed. All they did was playing video games and watching movies. At 5 in the morning my nephew texted his little sister that he was coming home at around 11-12 and then they all went to bed (all three slept in the same bed).   At 11 the friend's father enters the room and finds my nephew on the floor stone-cold dead. Probably been dead for a few hours. Anyway they all freaked out and started CPR and called 911. When help arrived they worked on him for about 30 minutes before going to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  About a week later I called the pathology lab asking if there was any information. I didn't talk to a doctor but the person read from some report that there were no structural causes for the sudden death. Heart was normal, no ruptures etc. The lungs were abit enlarged and that the brain weighed too much (cerebral edema?). They have taken samples and biopsies that's been sent away for analyzing.   We're at a loss here... I have two scenarios in my head. First, he just died. Sudden cardiac death without structural cause (cardiomyopathy etc), maybe caused by some recreational drug. Second, he OD'd on opiates and fell out of bed and stopped breathing. This however feels so out of character for him. It also seem strange to take something just before going to bed.   What do you all think? Is there anything im missing or not seeing clearly? Or maybe someone with more expertise?","__index_level_0__":6339}

{"post_id":"4200cz","history":"I'd take a pay hit if I take a new job; should I negotiate? Also, will I be burning bridges if I take the new job? [x-posted] I've been in my current job as a Quality Manager for 3.5 years. I had two promotions in that time and have gotten 115% of my merit bonuses each year, due to doing a good job here. It's my 2nd job out of college; I was in my first job for about 4 years. Although I'm a manager level, I don't manage anyone but interns - I have a hunch they gave me this promotion and title change so I wouldn't leave. (We have a really high turnover, so someone like me who has been here for a while is more valuable as time goes on.)  At the start of this month, I recently switched to a different area in Quality but kept my title. I just wanted a change in the type of work I was doing, a spot was open, I'd worked for the director before, so I figured it would be a good spot. Plus, I've been bored for quite a while.  Well, last week I got an email from a recruiter that actually sparked my interest. I have a phone screen today with HR before I presumably move to the next level to an in-person interview with the hiring manager.  My issues are:  1. I'd take a 10% pay hit if I take this job. (Big con.)  1. I'd have a title change back down to a Senior Engineer. (Slight con.)  1. My work-life balance would be immensely better. (Huge pro.)  1. My commute would be 40% of what it is now, and I wouldn't have to pay tolls each way. (Pro.)  1. The job responsibilities are nearly identical to the one I just switched out of internally at my current employer; the only difference is that it's in a different industry with all sorts of regulations I've never dealt with before. (Neutral.)  1. They've been looking to fill this position since November, so they are likely really eager to hire someone with my experience. (Slight pro.)  If all goes well in the interview process, I'll likely accept this job. My two questions are:  1. Would I be burning bridges by accepting the new job? I just started a kinda-new position at my current employer and I feel like I may be screwing them over by leaving so soon after this switch.  1. Given that they are likely really eager to hire someone for this long-open position, and given that I'd be taking a pay cut (and they'd be aware of this when I tell them my salary requirement) do I have an opportunity to negotiate salary, benefits, etc. with them? I've never had to do such a thing before, and part of me would like some extra compensation for taking the pay hit. However, given that my title will no longer be a \"Manager\", would it be ridiculous of me to still want to be compensated like one?","__index_level_0__":9248}

{"post_id":"lpeeqs","history":"Why do Communist societies that we've seen tend toward authoritarianism and dictatorial-style arrangements? First off, I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge on this topic, and want to note that I almost asked this in \/r\/NoStupidQuestions but decided an educated answer would be better than a flamewar. And before anyone says it, sure, maybe prehistoric tribes can be labelled \"communist\" and maybe didn't operate this way, but I am referring to the myriad 20th century communist countries that made up the \"second World\".   It's hard to get a clear answer without devolving into \"communism bad\" \"no, communism good\". From what I can tell, it's not necessarily required for a communist state to have a single authoritarian leader, yet all real-world examples I can think of had very consolidated power arrangements into a single position? There are free-market dictatorships and free-market republics, but it seems that any Communist state went down an authoritarian route of some kind-- Stalin, Tito, Mao, Castro? I'm familiar with the concept of the Vanguard of the Revolution, but surely this is not the only way to proceed forward?  Some hypotheses I've had on the matter include:   * Maybe I'm saturated in propaganda from an American public school system and actually the dictatorish nature of Communist societies I'd heard about is exaggerated\/didn't hear about the examples where this didn't happen?   * Or, if it was accurate, it was a \"fruit of the poisoned tree\" situation, where since the Soviets went down a dictatorial Stalinist path and assisted the other communist countries in setting up, they imprinted this system onto them as well?   * There's also an issue of post-revolution political disarray generally giving rise to tyrants, which, when combined with Communism often being instated via revolution, yields a high risk of a tyrant seizing power.

{"post_id":"f1vt4z","history":"CMV: There would be nothing wrong with the apparent 'dark' future, where we all end up hooked up to a system that directly stimulates our brain. \"Genuine\" existence has no real meaning or value. Everyone seems to think that advancements in technology are great, but that we need to avoid this dystopian future that we're heading towards. They think it would be depressing if no-one interacted in the real world anymore and were simply hooked up to a machine that stimulated our brains, or simulated a virtual existence. Let's assume this is a perfect system that can affect our brain however it chooses, keeping us alive indefinitely (or at least as long as you'd live otherwise). People who I tend to follow\/agree with talk about it like this would be a nightmare future we should avoid.  &#x200B;  My arguments against this:  \\- Anything you feel is lost by this, you wouldn't feel. If you're seeking feeling some kind of genuine experience, where some suffering is required to reach an overall earned outcome, you would feel this. Your genuinity sensors are firing on overdrive, more than you could experience in the 'real' world.  \\- All positive experiences can be exaggerated to an otherwise impossible extent. What we think of as the peak happiness\/experience could be 0.00001% of what this system makes us feel. No matter what your brains preferred state is.  \\- In all likelihood, what we consider the 'real' world is probably some form of illusion anyway. Whether it's organic (some form of universe 'creating' this one as an illusion), artificial (a simulation in the mathematical\/computational sense), organic-artificial (eg. a 'dream'), or any kind of solipsism. It's definitely another topic to argue why this is the case, but the starting point should be assuming it's one of the many possibilities of a non-reality, rather than blindly assuming it's the one real top-level genuine reality. But that aside, if you believed the world was an illusion in some form, would it not be better to go one level deeper if it meant you felt a more positive experience?  \\- Any feeling of 'greater good' you have, or feeling\/intention about continuing the human race and ensuring our survival, you will feel that but to a more satisfying extent. Or, we could assume that's taken care of by the system we're plugged into.  \\- This direct brain manipulation could mean that you perceive existence for much longer. Similar to how people report that with certain drugs, their time 'under' feels a lot longer than realtime (I think DMT is an example of this). So not only are you experiencing an infinitely better existence, it can feel infinitely longer.  &#x200B;  I'm not trying to persuade anyone of the likelihood of this or how feasible it is, and I'm assuming certain 'features' of this system that might be unrealistic.

{"post_id":"n5iw3a","history":"CMV: NaN has no place in modern high-level languages In computing, NaN, or Not a Number, represents a value that is undefined or unrepresentable, especially in floating-point arithmetic. As I undestand, it's mostly used as a low-level optimization, so that you don't have to check for bad values while doing consecutive calculations. I think modern high-level languages should not use NaN. My reasoning is:  * You still have to check for NaN at the end. This doesn't save you any typing * It leads to inconsistencies that you have to keep in mind. E.g. `nan in [nan]` is true while `nan == nan` is false. Can you off the top of your head say what should be the result of the following:   * `1 \/ 0` and `nan \/ 0`   * `sqrt(-1)` and `sqrt(nan)`? * NaN can lead to rare crashes. As `1 < nan` and `1 > nan` are both false, using it for sorting can lead to some very hard to debug exceptions. Not only these won't signal the presence of NaN, but depending on your data can happen so rarely you would have troubles reproducing the issue.  Instead, an exception should be raised when an operation is invalid. CMV","__index_level_0__":14789}

{"post_id":"s91j02","history":"The vet said my dog is going to die tonight. Just a little back story, I rescued my Male pit bull from animal services 6 years ago when he was approximately 3 years old. He was found on the street positive with heart worms, he was treated after I adopted him and made a full recovery from that.   About 5 months ago He developed a fatty ball on his belly button just above his penis. Probably the size of half an orange fruit. Very squishy and he didn\u2019t seem to be bothered when I touch it .  2 days ago he started acting a little weird as in not eating as much when typically he finishes his whole bowl.   Yesterday he through up what looked like, brown almost digested food.  On our walk this afternoon I noticed he was bloated and then I checked his belly and the fatty bump was gone. There was probably a little tiny bit of fatty lump the size of a dime that was left. He wasn\u2019t acting normal either. Decided to take him directly to the vet.  Finally they call me in to the room to be seen after waiting an hour.   The vet came in and saw my dog laying on the floor and the first thing he said was how he could tell immediately my dog is very sick. Vet checked his mouth, very pale. Vet Explained his blood is not traveling. Vet checked poop, looks fine. I did tell the vet about the lump. After one abdominal X-ray the vet immediately knew something was wrong. Took me back to explain the Xray. There\u2019s a mas and fluid pushing his organs. The vet thinks it\u2019s terminal cancer. Vet said it could be liver, not really sure. This vet is very blunt and has been around for a very long time. Vet was explaining that we would need to find out what\u2019s killing him. Recommended a ultra sound but also stated we wouldn\u2019t really know unless they went in with surgery. I also want to mention after the vet checked his blood he seemed like he was blown away at how normal it was. The vet had mentioned anemia killing him but once he looked at the blood he dropped that possible diagnoses. This vet visit was pretty much all over the place and very emotional for me.   Ending diagnosis was a mas in his abdomen bleeding and fluid in his abdomen.  DR left me with a choice to put my dog down which he recommended or to take My dog home and he will die at home tonight. And the vet mentioned my dog will slip into a coma state.   I asked the vet if he was in pain, he said no. decided to take my dog home. The doctor didn\u2019t want to give him medication or even stick a needle to drain anything as he didn\u2019t want to worsen the situation.   Also before we left the vet did ask if he got into any toxic things or medication as it causes things like this. My dog isn\u2019t really known to eat anything that isn\u2019t food. He\u2019s very well behaved.    I thought about this whole experience alot and it seems like what it\u2019s coming down to is $$ to be able to diagnose properly. So I called around to get an ultrasound but since it\u2019s night time no one is available even at emergency clinics.   The plan is to keep him alive through the night so we can atleast do an ultra sound to hopefully get a Diagnosis in the morning.

They wanted to turn the project into something publishable and I agreed thinking I could do it. We had bumps along the way with figuring out how to do our project and it somewhat changed so now it's just taking longer to complete. I've since graduated in 2020 and am still working on this with them (2yrs on this project) but after I graduated, I really just wanted to move on and have the project passed on to another undergrad to finish, though I know I've made a commitment to create this paper with them. I honestly don't care about having my name first on the publication at this point - which was something that enticed me at first being an undergrad. I'll be starting graduate school in fall and really want to cut ties with this project.  I just feel like it's being dragged out and I want to focus on a project that's more my own.    I'm not sure how to approach my PI about this - like it'll probably look bad since I'm going to do more research in grad school right?

It was more tender than the one from the restaurant but was less sweet with a noticeable fishy taste. The two lobster were approximately of the same  size.  The only thing that I may have done wrong is that I used a heaping teaspoon of salt per quart. Note: in the restaurant the lobster was served whole and I was the one who extracted the meat out of the shell, so I ruled out the possibility that the restaurant had any impact on the taste of the lobster other than the smoking.

{"post_id":"wv4z1p","history":"Southern California, car was \"repossessed\" while under supervision of my mom's ex-gf, despite the car being 15 years old, completely paid off, and with no leans. tl;dr    Some guy came and just drove off my BMW at my moms ex-gf's work parking lot. The car was NOT towed away. The city that it was towed in stated that the car was reported repossessed. Guy claims he has the pink slip and owns the car. (We have the pink slip). Number and business given to us by Police Department lead to a dead line, and the lot has been closed for 2 months. The car was effectively stolen and nobody can help us because the city of \\~\\~blank\\~\\~ reported it as repo'd, which means we can't even report stolen to our insurance.      List of facts:   \\-Mom is not on great terms with ex.   \\-We last saw the car on Sunday, the 14th.   \\-The Police department was shown \"proof\" (their words) that this vehicle was repo'd via a call.  \\-Car was repo'd Tuesday afternoon, the 16th  \\-We weren't notified until the 17th.   &#x200B;  So, we call ex Wednesday morning to get the car back so that we can get some general maintenance done on it cause it's an old bmw and burns oil lol. And she tells us if it's a joke, and that we \"already had the car since yesterday\" and that \"everyone saw us take the car\". This is not true because my mother was with me the whole day on tuesday, and then I went to work. So we go on high alert, and go to ex's house to see if she's just fucking with us to try and get us to see her again. She only has the keys. She claimed that we drove off the bmw with our spare keys but...we don't have spare keys for the car. Only one pair of keys, which are the ones that she had. We take the keys and call the local police department, and they tell us that the car was repo'd under the company name of \"Image Auto\" and given a number that leads to a dead line.      So we call back and ask for the number that the guy called from. We call that number, and some guy that sounds like the redhead from megamind answers. We ask him if he knows anything about a blue bmw, he says he doesn't. We end the call and call back the police, they redirect us to the records department in the city sheriffs office. They even tell us that this is very new to them and that they've never seen this before. The sheriff then calls the number, and the comes back to us saying that the guy claims that he owns the vehicle, and has the pink slip. It was now a civil matter, and out of their hands. So we go the DMV to get any information on this.      DMV prints out the history of the vehicle and proves that there are no leans on the vehicle and that it belongs to my mother and I, and the only other person in the history is the person we bought it from as a prior owner for a handful of years before. That is it. There is nothing else on the list.      Now it becomes a legal matter again. But the police department refuses to help us because we don't have the original pink slip. Of course we don't have the original pink slip. The DMV kept it when they sent us the new one when we did the title transfer. I don't know what we can do. We already reported the whole situation to the DMV as fraud but...like, all we have in terms of the guy is the name Tony, and his company lot. That's it. We know nothing else. We were told that the dmv would send out an investigator some time next week. We just want to see proof that this guy has some kinda lean on our car.

The CEO is a young woman of about 35 who appears to have some trouble managing expectations, employee workload and customer complaints. A few months back I was working in a 4 person team, and I estimated my workload at around 120% capacity. We dont get paid overtime, but I still worked longer hours in order to keep clients happy. Of the other 3 people in my team, one has since quit, the other went on a long holiday and the third got Covid. Three new very important and time-consuming projects were also added to my workload, which means I'm at around 200% capacity. My absent team members were not replaced, and several clients got seriously upset at the decrease in quality of service.   I started to feel down in the dumps and drained all the time. I talked to my bosses and provided them with a list of my weekly tasks with an estimate of time needed to accomplish each, and it added up to an 80 hour work week. They offered no solution, because apparently no candidates reply to their job offers. I routinely started getting yelled at by clients and my bosses alike whenever the quality of my work was not up to standard.

{"post_id":"pnhrn0","history":"CMV: In a Representative Democracy, there should be no Winning or Losing in Elections. So, it is often taken for granted that the US (I will be using the US for this post, but this can be applied to any representative \"democratic\" body) that we have representative democracy.  We do not.  **If you \"vote\" for a candidate in a representative body that loses their election, you have no voice in our democracy.**  In order to give people true voices in their politics, we should move to affirmational representation.  This would mean the following:  1. Elections are just periods in which you can select your representative. 2. Any representative is now a member of that body representing  and casting X # of votes. 3. For ease of discussion and debate (US House of Reps example) only the top 435 representatives sit in the house for debate.  Others can cast votes, but not debate.  4. Voting inside the body will thus be based on total votes.  For example, you may need 150,000,000+ votes to pass a bill in the House of Reps in the United States. 5. Non-voters could be considered \"okay with any\" and their representation could be split proportionally amongst all eligible. 6. A person election to say \"none of these\" would be a vote of no confidence, and thus \"against\" any bill that comes before the body. 7. Same restrictions on candidacy, term limits, etc. can apply is so chosen.  Example of how this would work:  1. You turn in a ballot with a person's name on it. 2. If they get enough votes to pass the minimum threshold (or not, maybe no threshold) is now your representative. 3. Every \"election\" you get to choose someone new, or the same person.

{"post_id":"8lpdg7","history":"Former PhD supervisor presented a poster at a major conference based on my dissertation without telling me and put himself as first author - Is this unethical and how should I respond? Some Background:   I graduated recently with my PhD and I have been trying to turn my dissertation chapters into published articles. My supervisor has been sitting on these manuscripts for months \\(one since November \\-\\-\\- 5 months ago\\) saying he hasn't found the time to read them and send feedback. This is despite the fact that I stressed to him several times how critical these publications were to me getting a job and building a career \\(I do not yet have any publications from my PhD time\\). I was lucky enough to secure a post\\-doc anyways, despite my publication record \\(although  I lost out on 3 before that specifically for that reason\\), on the premise that these publications were forthcoming.  The Current Issue:  I was not able to attend a major conference this year, but a colleague contacted me to tell me they saw \"my poster,\" which I didn't know I had.  It turns out my former supervisor had made a conference poster based on a chapter from my dissertation without telling me. In fact, the graphs are copy and pasted from the chapter\/manuscript that he \"hasn't had time to read\" since November. Moreover, he listed himself as the first author and as far as I can tell didn't even cite my dissertation \\(My friend sent me a blurry picture of the poster\\). He did list me as the second author.  So, I could use some advice.  1.\\) Is this unethical behavior? My instinct is that it's at least borderline unethical, but I don't want to blow this out of proportion. The fact that he did not tell me bothers me for several reasons including not knowing to add the poster to my CV \\(which I need since he hasn't let me publish\\) and the fact that I feel like he gave himself more credit for this work than he deserves \\(Yes, it's his lab's research but I did a significant proportion of the work involved\\).  2.\\) Should I say something? If this is unethical behavior, I do not think I should let it slide as that will only encourage him to do stuff like this to future students, nor do I want to set a precedent of being a push\\-over \\(for myself and to others\\). Also, he has been delaying publications for months and months and yet had the time to make a poster based on the work that he claims he hasn't had the time to get to.   3.\\) If I am going to say something, do you have any advice on what I should say or how I should frame the issue?   I am worried about how this will play out in the future. I no longer need a letter of recommendation from this person for jobs \\(which is why I held my tongue in regards to previous issues I had with him\\), but I do need to finish several publications with him which I really need for my career and to show my current job I wasn't BS'ing about having forthcoming publications.

I researched, published, presented, taught, and studied everything I could get my hands on. (I had an academic scholarship, and milked it for all it was worth.)  Toward the end of my degree, I read several hundred blog posts and articles about the demise of academia, the dearth of tenure-track positions, and how grad school will ruin one\u2019s life and leave one penniless, friendless, and soulless.

As I was getting out of my car, the neighbor (whom I never met) walked passed me with her two dogs and a pizza and approached my dock. I saw a guy from the group of ten meet her on my dock and she gave him the pizza.

{"post_id":"bz0nxk","history":"Considering telling my boss that I intend to leave the company in a year. Is this a bad idea? I know what the conventional response is: do not tell your company you intend to quit unless you can afford to be fired that same day. I have seen it on this subreddit, \/r\/personalfinance, \/r\/cscareerquestions, etc.   However, I think my situation is unique. I am on a team supporting a project. We previously had 7 people. About 8 months ago, the most senior member on the team, and the only other engineer working with me onsite, retired. We knew this was going to happen, but it was still a huge loss of knowledge. Last week the project manager put in her two weeks' notice for personal reasons. I posted about how I think I am going to have to absorb her responsibility last week. It appears clear now that that is what some of the higher-ups are planning. Previously I was already sort of irreplaceable, but if this happens, I will be the most important member of the project team by far (which is a bad idea in my opinion, beer truck succession planning, etc, in addition to this being well outside of my experience level).   The timing for this expansion is also not great because in two months I start an online master's program in a different field, so I don't really want more responsibility and I definitely don't want more stress. I am a chemical engineer and the master's is in computer science, so not that closely related. To tell my boss that I am starting this program would be tantamount to me telling him I intend to quit at some point in the near future. So there is no telling him one without the other.   Part of me wants to just level with my boss, tell him of my intentions: master's program in August, leave in ~May 2020, support the project until then. There is absolutely 0% chance that I will get fired for telling him this, I can say that for an absolute fact. My company would take at minimum 6 months to get a competent replacement for the previous project manager up to speed, similarly for me. Both the project manager and myself have been working on this project since day one, so we are incredibly familiar with the details of the project. The company literally could not afford to lose both of us. There would be no one left to support the project from an operational and managerial aspect.   What do I have to gain by doing this? Probably not much besides being honest with my boss and allowing them to avert disaster by concentrating all of this responsibility on me and then have me quit in a year (less of a disaster if the project is complete by then, 50\/50 shot of that happening). It could help them figure out how we are going to push the project along without putting far too much of the responsibility on me, which would probably result in a better finished product at the end of project.  What do I have to lose by doing this? Nothing really. Or nothing that would matter really. They can't fire me today. If they chose to \"punish\" me in other ways, reduced COL adjustment next year or something, the impact would be insignificant. If they hired a replacement and got them trained up and then fired me in 6 months, that wouldn't be catastrophic either. I have a decent amount saved up already in preparation for quitting. I would find some way to make some income that would allow more time to focus on and accelerate my studies.   What do I have to gain by doing nothing? Nothing. I don't want more responsibility and I'm not looking for more exposure to grow my career within the company.   What do I have to lose by doing nothing? Possible impacts to my studies (remains to be seen, but there would definitely be an increased time commitment).   Any advice would be appreciated.","__index_level_0__":8795}

She brought up the fact that he's married, and he acknowledged it. He wanted her to come to his house to meet his wife. She agreed, and so they went to his place. My friend met the wife, and they all drank some more. At this point, my friend blacked out and can't remember anything that happened after this point.

Hopefully not too ignorant of a question, I'm pretty new to reading about theories of consciousness. Maybe I'm missing something?  I understand materialism as consciousness being based on matter, some kind of result of physical reactions to inputs.  Someone with a mental illness like schizophrenia, which might be related to dopamine problems in the brain, means that there's physical difference that effects their conscious experience. Similar for drugs, a new chemical is introduced and the conscious experience of the person receiving the drug changes significantly. With anesthetics consciousness seems to go away completely and psychedelics alter it.  It seems like the fact that when chemicals in the brain are modified, conscious experience changes would be a strong piece of evidence for materialism?

{"post_id":"ia1mdx","history":"My wife is depressed and can't lose weight Hello medical professionals.  I have a question about my wife, she doesnt use reddit, so I wanted to ask for her.  My wife (29F) is about 5'7\" and 165lbs.  She's had 3 kids, the youngest being 2 and the oldest being 7.  She has an incrediblely difficult time losing weight.  She is by no means what I consider overweight, but she wants to lose weight, and there is weight to lose.  We have a Peloton bike and she uses it about an hour every day along with strength trainings 3-4 times a week.  She has been doing the OMAD (One Meal a Day) diet for over a month and she has not been able to lose any weight.  She has been on various workout regimes and diets for a couple of years with no noticeable effects.  Its tough for me to watch since she tries so so hard, adheres to very strick diets, works out like nobody else I've ever seen and she still can't lose any weight.  I feel like if anyone else was doing what she does they'd be losing tons of weight.  Whenever I do her diets and workouts I end up losing weight so fast.  She also suffers from depression.  She takes a low dose of FLUoxetine (10mg a day), and her struggles with losing weight usually put her in a bout of depression a few times a week. She also gets depressed easily about other things, but most of the time it is from her not losing weight.  When she is depressed she has a hard time being motivated to do anything and she talks about how much she hates herself.  I do feel like it is depression rather than just being bummed.  She is also very sensitive to foods and sugar. If she eats something sugary on an empty stomach, she gets sick to her stomache. She can't drink soda because it makes her sick, and just overall has a very sensitive stomach.  She had a really hard time with the OMAD diet when she started because she would would feel sick to her stomach if she hadn't eaten, but she says it's not bad anymore.  We were sure she had hyperthyroidism since the symptoms seemed to fall in line with that.  We went to our pcp and they did the tests for hyperthyroidism and she also tested her for diabetes.  We got the test results tonight and they all came back in the normal range, so she doesnt have hyperthyroidism or diabetes. This put her in a depressed mood because she feels like she just isn't doing enough to lose weight and she was so sure this was the issue.   I have a hard time believing that there isnt something wrong with her body and I just feel like there is an underlying issue. My wife doesn't want to go back to the pcp since she is so embarrassed by this. I wanted to get all of your thoughts and see if you have seen anything similar.  I really just want my wife back, her depression has taken a big toll on me and I struggle seeing her so down on herself all the time and there is nothing I do or say that helps.

This is for a job in a European Union country, and paternity leave is for three months.  I am in the interview process for a job, and progressed to the final round.  No offer or decision has been made as of yet.  After the final round of interviews, I informed my HR contact that my wife is 6 months pregnant.  In researching about when is the best time to drop this information on potential employers, I have heard a variety of responses, but they seem to fall into two camps: (1) Don't inform until there is an offer on the table and (2) Don't inform until the offer is signed and done.  Based on this, I fear I may have made a mistake by disclosing my wife's pregnancy too early.  In r\/askhr's opinion, when is the best time to make this disclosure?

{"post_id":"xuv8az","history":"Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit,  It\u2019s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20).  I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later.  At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one.   The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success.  From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling:  1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals.  This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\".  5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers \/ lower citations. I get upset when they are further along the line.   I am happy that I can share this here and would be looking forward to hearing perspectives or maybe strategies on how to work on this \u2014 or even telling me this is normal.

To add to the story, I haven\u2019t received my review in writing but plan to ask on Monday. Im also going to email a response to the review on Monday as well. Not sure how to move forward if I cant prove what was said. Im also debating whether or not I should speak to Amy\u2019s boss when they come on Monday and how shes creating issues at work.   I am an hourly employee in CA and recently I had to set boundaries with my coworkers regarding my breaks and lunches. I don\u2019t want to give too much info in fear of being identified but my job is basically a glorified secretary. I acknowledge my mistakes of being a people pleaser and doing the most to help people, but I am doing a lot better at respecting my boundaries.   I am pretty friendly with a lot of people there, including the mail clerk \u201cAmy\u201d. Last week I was eating lunch in the office (which I rarely do due to never being able to eat in peace) when Amy comes in to tell me the vendor needed a signature. I was surprised she did this because I have lamented to Amy about people constantly bugging me on my lunches in the past. The first time she interrupted me, I let her know to let a supervisor or someone else in the office to sign for it. She came in a second time to ask about the vendor again, this time I had to be firm and remind her I am at lunch. She walked away embarrassed and I did feel bad but I was not disrespectful and did not raise my voice.  Yesterday I had a review and despite my good marks, I only get docked for not being \u201cempathetic\u201d to my peers and was given the interaction with Amy as an example. According to my director, Amy said that I yelled at her that I was on my lunch and refused to help or give direction. Which was just not true and a twisted version of events. I explained to my director my side and they were shocked at how different the two stories were. I defended myself by telling her that I was just enforcing my boundaries and gave a few examples of my own of situations where people just walked all over me. Again they were shocked and I could tell embarrassed from not knowing the full story and being so quick to judge.   So now I feel like Im seen as a jerk at work for just wanting to take my 30 min uninterrupted lunch according to CA law.

My down payment, my credit, my mortgage. He didn\u2019t pay anything. His name was never on anything. Not the title, not the insurance, not the mortgage, not even the utilities.   We did have an unwritten agreement that he\u2019d pay half the mortgage, utilities, and other shared expenses like groceries. And for about a year, maybe, he did pay me varying amounts of money. It was never half, and it caused a lot of arguments. Whatever he paid me, he paid in cash. Since summer 2011 I have paid all of it. He pays for whatever food he eats outside of groceries and covers whatever expenses he has. I don\u2019t know anything about that. He runs \u201cbusinesses\u201d that include a youtube channel, a Twitch channel, and he\u2019s in a band. I don\u2019t have any idea how much money he made at them, or if he made any at all.   For a number of reasons, including this ridiculous financial situation, I ended our relationship in mid-March. I told him I was planning to move out of state without him and that he needed to leave the house. I told him to be out by mid July.   He totally ignored me and did nothing. July came and went. I moved out of state. He stayed in my house. I began communicating with him only by email - I told him I wanted to have the house on the market by October, that he had to be out etc. He continued to ignore me, and I had to get a lawyer who served him with a notice of eviction at the beginning of October. He challenged the eviction and the court date is the first week of November.   Through all of this the ex refused to communicate. I never had any idea what he was thinking.

The entiere street and neighborhood smells like a rotting dumpster like you would expect behind a seafood restaurant in the summer.  When he was asked by one neighbor and myself, he said he would get the pigs slaughtered last month. Well. September passed and no change. When asked again what the situation with the pigs is, he said, and I quote \u201ci\u2019m going to get more, and i\u2019ll do whatever the fuck i want until the law says i can\u2019t\u201d  So now, he\u2019s being belligerent, and threatening to bring in more pigs, and has literally rotton food slop hauled in from a nearby restaurant to feed them. Every time a truck goes by or wind blows, the entire place smells like hot rotton food. Even with closed windows we can still smell it inside our homes. It\u2019s October and we still have flies and maggots because of the pigs.  We brought the matter up to the town council but they haven\u2019t done much, because they don\u2019t want to upset chicken owners (there are a lot of people who keep chickens for the eggs here) \u2014 it\u2019s a mess.  This is a small, rural town in Southern Vermont. We\u2019re at our wits end and not sure what direction to take this. We tried asking nicely, were told to fuck off. We tried asking at the town council and nothing will likely happen.  Now the neighbor with the pigs is threatening retaliation and wants to bring more.  Pigs are pigs. Can\u2019t blame them for what they are, but having pigs in cramped spaces, next to 4 other residential houses to the point where you can\u2019t open a window or go outside because it smells so bad, and now there\u2019s coyotes and other predators coming around because of it\u2026 2 little kids live there and are always sick, it\u2019s out of hand.  Where can I start or what can I do to get this guy to stop acting like an agricultural unit in a residential area and keeping pigs on a tiny parcel of land?","__index_level_0__":18028}
{"post_id":"zfu5qv","history":"[MCU\/Marvel] Why do superheroes not collaborate more\/share resources in the marvel universe? I've been thinking about this alot especially as a big fan of the marvel movies. Why do the superheroes not share resources\/technology or aid more with one another in the marvel universe? I want to be clear i absolutely love these movies and these characters but they seem to constantly go \"lone wolf\" and put themselves or their mission in danger when it is completely unnecessary. Even if it meant waiting to resolve the situation until help could arrive to ensure the best possible outcome  For example in Spiderman- No Way Home, Peter Parker struggles tremendously against the villains in that film and it costs him his aunt may and nearly MJ. He did at one point have the help of Dr. Strange but in fairness they had a disagreement on the proper resolution to the situation so i will allow that. Why didn't Peter make a phone call or send an Avengers SOS to Sam Wilson, Hulk, Hawkeye, Antman or any of the thousands of people that showed up in the Endgame battle? He did have the help of the other spidermen but at that point he had already lost his aunt. In Endgame we see that the heroes were able to regroup and rally into a large fighting force really quickly if the situation demands it. The multiverse was literally tearing itself apart. In Falcon and the Winter soldier we see that  Sam as the new Captain America had a pretty good handle on the situation but why not call Spider-man or Hulk for back up just in case? He clearly had to travel the long distance from Louisiana to New York, why not make a quick phone call to ask Avengers that might be nearby for help if they are available? If it meant saving more lives why not? Sam and Bucky are both military veterans and should know better than anyone the value of having a solid team and backup in any situation, regardless of how good of a handle you think you have on the situation.  Secondly, why dont the Avengers share technology and resources. We see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier that Sam is in dire financial straits due to the Avengers not actually paying him. Why is this? Even as an informal group why wouldn't Tony fund the group with paychecks and equipment? We see in Age of Ultron that he reformatted Stark tower into a makeshift base of operations. Why not make the Avengers unofficial stark employees so they could be compensated for their time? Peter seems to be the only one that received some manner of compensation in the form of a scholarship and a suit.  With regard to equipment i dont understand why Tony didn't give everyone a mini upgrade to their equipment. Spiderman receives an excellent nanotech suit but why didn't he give Captain America a suit that gives him a strength or speed boost? Hawkeye and Black Widow are incredibly skilled but a basic set of nanotech body armor, even without any bells and whistles would keep them much safer and maybe add a few additional tricks into their arsenal. I dont see why they would turn it down out of \"personal preference\" if it meant it an emergency situation that it might mean the difference between life and death for civilians or themselves. Quicksilver might've been saved incredibly easily if he was wearing a pretty basic Stark tech level set of body armor. Or Hawkeye could've saved himself if he had that shield generator that stark used in Endgame.  &#x200B;  For clarification im not saying the full might of the Avengers was necessary for every mugger and car crash. But for the big stuff... why dont they ask each other for help?","__index_level_0__":12642}

When you ordered your taco's, they'd grab a hunk of meat, cut off a chunk, and start cooking it on the raised dome of the sombrero pan.  That part was significantly hotter than the oil bath.  While they did that, they threw silver dollar sized corn tortillas into the oil, then when the meat was done they chopped it up finely(all on the dome mind you) then they'd pull the tortilla out of the oil, fry them on the dome for a few seconds on each side.  They do two tortillas per taco, fill with meat and shredded cabbage(never seen lettuce in Mexico), onions, tomatoes, etc...  I'd just get the meat.

{"post_id":"8pmskw","history":"CMV: A salaried worker who only needs to work 40 hours a week should never (unless ABSOLUTELY necessary) work a single minute beyond that. I have worked with such people all over the place. They routinely put in 9-10 hour days when they are only required to work 8. From what I can tell, generally it is not anything pressing. There is no imminent deadline. They simply choose to continue working when they could easily continue the work tomorrow (which they generally always need to do anyway).  Above all else, it's a matter of getting the most out of your life. 90% of people are not happy with their jobs, so it's highly unlikely that anyone who is presently at work is enjoying their life more than they would be if they were not at work.  Simply put, there is no legal requirement for you to work beyond this. An employer cannot force you to stay at work beyond 40 hours as a salaried employee. Are there fires to fight sometimes? Sure! Please do note that I'm accounting for this, that sometimes you do need to stay late. But in my experience, the people who stay late often aren't doing it because of all the crises they are fighting; they are simply choosing to stay at work longer.  If you have a job where you ARE constantly fighting fires and having to stay late, then the smart thing to do would be to get a new job, one that actually allows you to go home at time. Those jobs exist. Don't lie to yourself and say they don't.  Why can't you walk out the door at quitting time? Why can't that task wait until tomorrow? Your company hired you to work 40 hours a week. This is why, when you're sick, you are deducted 8 hours, not 9 or 10. They can't tell you you HAVE to stay late, and if they DO, then get the hell out of that job.  Honestly, the employees I see that routinely stay late are, in fact, very INefficient workers. A great example of when I had to stay late recently was a meeting scheduled for 60 minutes, yet it went for 90, and all we did was review and discuss 5 slides of data. 5. But the people in this meeting took incredibly circuitous routes in making their points and simply could not summarize their thoughts or get beyond the \"analysis paralysis\". And because of this I got to watch one fewer episode of Modern Family which I love dearly.  The only legit reason I can think of to stay late is if you want more money or want promotions and what not. But I reject the notion that money will make you happy, and if that happiness comes at the expense of actually having the time to spend it, then what's the point? Working hard at a job you don't like to make more money is like trying to get yourself comfy on a tight airplane seat vs. lying down on a cushy sofa. There's a clear winner here.  To sum up: HAVE to stay late too much? Get a new job. Insist that your work really does take you 9-10 hours? Get more efficient. Remember that you are likely among the 90% of people who dislikes your job, so spending so much as 1 extra minute on it is like willingly setting your hands on a hot stove.","__index_level_0__":15493}

{"post_id":"fof2q9","history":"CMV: r\/FemaleDatingStrategy is a toxic, hateful sub filled with bad advice and shouldn't be viewed as a positive community on reddit. I'm writing this because while in my experience condemnation of or at least acknowledgement of the toxicity, hatefulness, and bad advice-full-ness of \"manosphere\" subs or communities focused around The Red Pill, Pick Up Artistry, or Men Going Their Own Way is nearly universal among people who are not in those communities, I have seen a fair number of people who are not r\/FemaleDatingStrategy users come to the defense of FDS with comments like \"oh they're just focused on helping women not get taken advantage of and ensuring they get the most out of dating, there's nothing wrong with that!\"  This kind of positive outsider view of FDS culminated in an article the Wall Street Journal published about FDS in which they praised the sub for offering \"actually practical advice in the age of dating apps,\" because \"Today\u2019s Tinderella must swipe through a lot of ugly profiles to find her prince,\" and claiming that \"The strategies that FDSers endorse, particularly for online dating, are backed by scientific research\" and concluding that \"If love is a battlefield, communities like Female Dating Strategy are trying to better arm some of the combatants.\"  I find it very hard to believe that a major publication like the WSJ would ever publish a favorable piece about a community like PUA or TRP the way they did for FDS. I looked. I found a bunch of major publications who dove into why PUA, TRP, and MGTOW are toxic, hateful, and filled with bad advice, but none praising them. This double standard maintained by many redditors and apparently by the writers for major news outlets in condemning TRP-like communities but not their female equivalents is, more than anything, what prompted me to make this post. It also means that if your counterargument is anything like \"well but TRP is toxic!\" it will not change my view on anything, because I agree with that already.  To the meat of why FDS is toxic, hateful, and filled with bad advice:  First it's worth looking at who uses FDS. According to subredditstats.com, r\/GenderCritical, reddit's largets TERF subreddit, has a user overlap of 151 with FDS, and is ranked as the most similar sub; r\/PinkpillFeminism, arguably reddit's largest and most overt misandristic subreddit, has a user overlap of 482 with FDS, and is also ranked as the most similar subreddit to it. In short, TERFs and misandrists are respectively 151 and 482 times more likely than the average reddit user to frequent FDS; FDS is, therefore, largely populated with transphobes (note it is \"female\" dating strategy, not \"womens\" dating strategy) and man-haters.  As for hatefulness, FDS maintains a host of dehumanizing terms for men, the most popular of which is \"moid,\" meaning a \"man like humanoid,\" meaning, \"something male but not entirely human.\" Another favorite is \"scrote,\" obviously referring to and reducing men down to their testicles, which can be seen in popular FDS flairs like \"The Scrotation,\" or \"Roast-A-Scrote\" or \"Scrotes Mad.\" Finally, \"Low Value Male\" (LVM) and \"High Value Male\" (HVM), which is a way FDS divides up men, not unlike the famous 1-10 scale many women find so degrading, like cattle, into groups that FDS sees as having something to offer them (height, a six pack, a six figure salary, a nice house, nice car, a large penis, etc.) and those who don't; if you lack those things, you are a \"low value\" man, according to FDS.  So lets just stop there for a moment and recap. Imagine there was a male-oriented reddit sub that had nearly a 150x - 500x user overlap with openly misogynistic and transphobic subs. Imagine they routinely referred to women solely as \"non-human female-like creatures,\" or \"vulvas\" or \"holes\" or referred to all women who weren't 120lbs or less with DD breasts and mean blowjob skills and a passion for anal as \"low value.\" Right there I think that would be more than enough to say that this hypothetical sub is toxic and hateful, not deserving of praise.  But FDS is also chalk-full of shitty advice.  * They make fun of men who are passionate about physical fitness (despite demanding men be fit) * \"If we\u2019re not fucking, I don\u2019t want to cuddle. If you\u2019re not taking me out, I don\u2019t want to see you.\" * They unironically support forced vasectomy * They think men who aren't immediately pushing for sex must have weird-looking or \"dysfunctional\" penises * They think that men will always treat women in their present exactly like women in their past and shouldn't be given any amount of time to decide if they want a serious relationship with women * They think that men have nothing to offer except money and attractiveness * They think that small penises aren't \"normal,\" are useless in bed, and women shouldn't be with a man who has one * Men are \"the fucking worst,\" \"trashy, overly sexual, disrespectful ass garbage,\" \"too timid,\" \"intellectually brain dead,\" \"boring,\" \"uncreative and lack curiosity,\" \"unattractive,\" \"shit as sex,\" and \"negligent.\" * They think that men should be \"instantly\" in love with them or they're not worth spending any time on  I could go on but I'm getting tired of linking stuff from there. I think you get the idea.  The final bit of toxicity and bad advice-nature of FDS took me a while to realize. I'm subbed to a lot of subs dealing with gendered and dating issues: GC, PPF, FDS, TRP, MGTOW, etc. As I said earlier, I regard the male versions of these subs as toxic, hateful, and counterproductive, but one (fairly common sense) thing that they get right is that self-improvement is a major prerequisite in regards to having success with women. Advice like \"lose weight, lift, get a sharp hair cut, upgrade your wardrobe, get a high paying job, get a nice car, and develop an interesting and entertaining personality\" is a dime a dozen on PUA and TRP-type subs. And it's not bad advice; if a guy isn't having luck with women, it makes sense to conclude there's probably something about him that needs to be improved so he'll have better chances.  It took me a while to notice, but FDS is totally bereft of any advice of this sort. They are not self-critical or interested in any true self-improvement. Their view on this is that all women are, by virtue of being women, automatically maximally awesome and desirable and deserving of Mr. Right or Prince Charming and the only \"self improvement\" required is that women realize this and stop settling for anything less. You will not find, or at least I haven't in like 6mo of being subbed there and *looking,* any posts telling women to work on their appearance or personality in order to help maximize their chances of success in dating. I would argue that this is both toxic and, in regards to dating, textbook bad advice; if you're repeatedly having bad interactions with the opposite sex the most logical thing to do is to examine the common denominator (and also the only thing you really control in the equation - you - and see what you could do improve yourself.

{"post_id":"2zygno","history":"How are engineering mistakes handled internally at your company? I've seen and experienced this numerous times.   A young engineer will make a mistake, the mistake will go unnoticed until already implemented in the field, mistake is noticed by Senior Engineer in the field and corrected with a change order. Young engineer is rolled under the bus in front of the client, in front of peers, and called out.   For example, I've witnessed a coworker, 1 year out school (as am I) tell a Senior Engineer that safety valve X is located in position Y and needs to be moved to location Z. Senior Engineer tells him he is mistaken and keeps rolling along until the valve is installed improperly in the field. The client observes the incorrect installation, questions us about it, and the young engineer is thrown under the bus in front of the client for being \"inexperienced\".   I've seen it times and times before with my employer and I'm not sure if this is normal. I understand if management or senior engineering looks incompetent in front of the client, then the client would quickly lose faith in our firm. But I don't think our company's philosophy of blaming young engineers for mistakes is proper, especially when mistakes could have been prevented through peer reviews, double checking drawings, etc. In general, our work environment is sink or swim, there is no mentoring, or strong sense of guidance.

I relied on some data generated by a previous student, so myself, him, and our PI are the only authors on the manuscript. My PI suggested that I send it to this 2nd author for review\/editing\/comments, and then a couple of other colleagues in the lab for internal review before the PI reads it himself.  The first round goes great and my 2nd author returns great comments after a week worth of 2 back and forth. I proceed to send it to the next person, who's a post-doc turned research associate - too long of a tenure as a post-doc, he had to switch to being an RA. I get my comments back from the RA and I see that he has added himself as an author on my paper. I looked through the document and the comments\/edits he's suggesting aren't any better\/more thorough than what my 2nd author did. Mostly grammar\/language and \"cite this please\" sort of commentary. I never discussed adding him as another author on my paper and I wasn't aware he was going to do it. From going through the document several times, I am also likely going to reject many of the edits as I don't think he fully grasped my paper and some of the comments are more confusing than helpful.  I haven't told my PI yet and I'm unsure if he has looked at the document.

{"post_id":"zo87m3","history":"future in academia This is my very first reddit post, and I don't fully know what I am expecting out of this. Hopefully this is the right place. Overall, I'm in a position where I am conflicted, and torn on how to proceed in academia. I think mostly, I am looking for some advise from other academics who have had similar experiences, or who have any insight in what I can do.    I have been at the same institution for almost 10 years now. I was an undergrad student, research assistant, grad student, adjunct, substitute lecturer, instructor, assistant professor, director of a lab, and director of the undergraduate program for 2 years. I was able to do all this within a 6 year time frame. Recently, I have been out on parental leave. I have worked extremely hard to climb the academic ladder, and I feel pretty content with how successful I have been.   Here is where the real fun comes in. My chair, has to be one of the most toxic individuals one could meet. To give context with my leave alone, I told her 5 months in advance I was going to use my parental leave (contractual right). Her response \"You are a father you should not be taking leave\", \"your wife isn't working, so she can take care of the baby\", \"this is unfair to the program and you should not be asking for leave\". To top things off, my wife was a high risk pregnancy (2 prior miscarriages) and my mom had stage 4 lung cancer. My mom ended up passing on Aug 14th of this year. From diagnosis to her passing, it was 5 months. To say this took a toll on me is an understatement. Meanwhile, the chair knew everything I was going through, and her response to my mom passing was \"time to get back to real life\". My leave officially started in October, and I received emails that were full of things that should not be said to anyone let alone someone already struggling with other life experiences. I've been in contact with the dean and she just says \"I dont know why she treats you like this\". The chair says \"hes like a son to me\" as if its some excuse to justify the abuse. She threatens that there are consequences, and told me I am shooting myself in the foot for now doing what she says. This was sent to the dean, union, and legal counsel. They told her to leave me alone during leave, but it will, without a doubt continue. After forwarding the harassing emails, the dean went MIA and hasn't said a word in months. I got in contact with my union, legal counsel and HR and they basically told her to leave me alone. From October until this past week, she left me alone. Now the emails start again. Nothing toxic, but right back to as if things are normal and what she did is just acceptable. This experience is only the recent one, I have recordings, and emails from the past 10 years of things similar and perhaps worse. She is short tempered, and respects no one. She, and other say its just her culture (shes turkish). Its still mind boggling to me that if this were any other job, she would have been fired. There are recordings others have sent the union of her being racist. Yet, she still continues as if nothing has happened.   The overall response from the dean was \"I need her as chair\". The chair is tenured, and intends to retire in 3 years. I don't want to see, hear or have anything to do with this woman. Just the thought of speaking with her gives me extreme anxiety. I wish this was an exaggeration, but every single interaction I have had with her has been abusing, toxic. Sadly, I am not alone in this. There has been at least 6 people who have left because of her, and the union said they aren't sure why she is still here. yet nothing is done, and the dean and other just say \"that is just how she is\". I fully intend to leave, and my last semester will be Spring 2024. I don't know what to do til then. I wish I could just quit, but i am the sole provider for my family. The pay isn't great, but I am a city employee, so the healthcare is extremely important.   I would sincerely appreciate any suggestions, words of wisdom or any guidance on what to do. No need to sugar coat anything, because I need to hear what needs to be said. I have justified the abuse, and have been convinced by others that I just have to deal with her behavior.   TLDR: Toxic chair who harnesses me. I can't deal with it for much longer, and I intend to leave Spring 2024. It has taken a toll on my mental health, and nothing has been done. What can I do until I leave to keep myself sane.","__index_level_0__":787}

I'm in Sydney Australia.  I posted a month ago, that my manager told me he wanted me out of my role, which i have successfully performed for several years, no disciplinary actions, etc. Said its for my benefit and his own philosophy that you should not be in a role for more than x years.  That he would help me look for new opportunities and that if i did not take another role within next 4 months, it would be different conversation, with the end result I would no longer have a role in the company.  I replied that, while I am happy to look for new opportunities, I was happy performing my current role until then. I also expect to be able to continue in my role without being undermined. Manager raised his eyebrows and said \"of course\".  Since then, Manager has done everything he can to isolate me.  He has tasked someone out of my department to run large project, that sits with the scope of my role. He refuses to talk to me or acknowledge me outside of meeting where others attend and mostly not even then.    In 1:1 discussions, I have to sit while he tells me how he is doing this tfor my benefit. In our last 1:1, I was upset and he demanded to know why. When I said I was not comfortable discussing why I was upset with him (6 times), he kept demanding to know - i then found out a manager at his level called out how upset I was and wanted to know what my manager was doing to support me.  I asked my manager, why he was asking, as its the first time he has ever asked how i am, do i need support; that he told me he wanted me out of my role, and offered no support HR Or any of the company support programs.  I said that in the last year, he has not once reached out while I was working from home (due to covid) or since, to ask how i am, etc, and when i have reached out, has said I dont want to deal with (me).  Managers reply (literally), I'll take that feedback on the chin.    Since then he has not spoken to me once, not online, not in meetings, not in corridor. Not even when another team member recognised me in a team meeting for excellent work.  I have started to document this behaviour, how isolated he has made me in the team, etc.  I am not a confrontational person, I genuinely dont know how to reply to what feels like a personal attack about me personally and professionally.  I also have a witness who has directly observed managers behaviours and the behaviours of his leadership team towards me, who has said he will go to HR if I need to.  It feels like constructive dismissal and bullying, but i dont know, I've not been in this position before. I always figured, work hard in my job, perform well, and as long as the company is not restructuring, you get to keep your job you know?   At this point, I feel so isolated, depressed and physically sick every day, that I have thought about going on long term stress leave, or just quitting and hiring an employment lawyer and suing the company.  I am getting medical attention for the stress.  I need to know if i should be reporting this to my companies HR?  And how to I phrase this conversation, as i've previously been told going to HR i may as well leave the company as they are just going to support my manager?","__index_level_0__":9686}

{"post_id":"37956u","history":"CMV: Whenever younger folks utter the phrase \"respect is earned, not given\" I can't help but understand it as a childish and short sighted attempt to undermine their elders. While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously \"earning\" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can.   However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.   Simply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions:   1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.  2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.  3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing.   4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\".   As such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\". CMV.  ____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

{"post_id":"1jocwx","history":"I think the 'culture' around alcohol is extremely toxic and needs to be fixed. CMV To start of, I realize how difficult of an issue this is. Banning alcohol flat-out would only cause problems and probably more than I know of, but my opinion is that the 'culture' we have built around alcohol in western society (I'm Western European, if anyone's interested) is very toxic to our every day life and especially children growing up.   My background preceding this view is, I think, important. So I'll start of with that. I grew up in a small village where alcohol and straight alcoholism is not treated as much of a big deal. In fact, people fail to recognize alcholism and problem-drinkers so extremely much that my own mother has grown up into extreme alcoholism without ever getting the help she has been needing for over at least 40 years. It has affected both herself and those close to her, including me. She has recently confessed to me that her problem had been going on for this long and that the people around her in her youth (my guess would be early 20's) thought her attitude towards alcohol was cool.   This is not rare. Especially villages have the risk of getting into extreme alcoholism and though I know I live in one of the worst places when it come to this issue (I have actually looked at statistics), I think it does highlight in a hyperbolic way how toxic the culture we live in can be to many people. Having grown up with an alcoholic has made me very sensitive to the signs of alcoholism and I recognize it a lot easier than most. My offers of help would be dismissed and ridiculed.  People who don't drink are called 'straight-edge', but not in a good way. I have made my own conscious decision to not drink, because doing so would be triggering to me. I couldn't hang around people who drink or casually go to a party without it being forced on me. I have had people get legitimately angry at me for not drinking. I 'spoil the fun', I'm prude and I'm boring. I am apparently not allowed to have fun without getting drunk.  I think every one of you at least knows someone who has a problem with alcohol and maybe even had it themselves. In how many of those cases did these people have to get into an accident, have to go through something horrible before they would get help?  In my opinion, the way we glorify alcohol in the media contributes to how hard it is for these people to get help. Commercials for alcohol are full of objectification of women and machismo.

{"post_id":"ietndq","history":"Shattered femur 2 months ago in DUI crash. Doctor feels neglectful because of the circumstances. Here's the x-ray that was taken last week. The accident and surgery were on the 15th of June.  https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/dcZowlj  Two months ago I crashed my car after passing out behind the wheel and not wearing a seat belt. I was going around 45 mph and slammed into a concrete electrical pole. This was a DUI crash and a huge wake-up call for me and the direction my life was going. It's really a case of I shouldn't be alive and I'm grateful to even be here making this post.  It feels like because of my circumstances my doctor doesn't have as much compassion for me as his other patients (I've heard him talking to other patients in the room next to mine at my appointments and his demeanor seems to be much more caring for them.) The appointments have not been more than 5-10 minutes with the doc. My first appointment was 3 weeks after the surgery and his advice to me was \"use crutches and don't fuck it up\".  His words not mine. His assistant had been talking to me earlier and said \"you probably won't need physical therapy\" and no mention about PT from the doc, just \"don't fuck it up. Fast forward a month later to last week, the first thing the doctor and assistant ask is \"how's therapy been\". I didn't even know I was supposed to be going? I told them I hadn't gone but I showed him that I was able to walk and bear weight without crutches but my leg would collapse if I wasn't stiffening out my knee. He then checked my knee and ordered an MRI and said \"yea with these types of injuries its common to injure the knee as well\". I got my MRI done 2 days ago and will be back to see the doc next week with my MRI results. If this is so common, why didn't they check for this earlier?  As far as the femur goes, he told me that it's just about looking healed. How is that possible? I still feel pain when I move my leg in certain ways, mostly in the inside of my thigh where the bone has split. It feels like the end of it is poking the inside of my leg. To me it doesn't look like it has healed much at all to me so that's why I'm here trying to get some second opinions.  I wanted to ask all this with the doctor but he seemed to get visibly annoyed and already on his way out to the next patient.  &#x200B;  Thank you in advance. I'm genuinely worried about my leg being messed up for the rest of my life and not being able to go back to the outdoor activities and sports I loved to do before this.","__index_level_0__":6374}

This all came about because I was discussing gear shift points for maximum acceleration, with some fellows on the interweb. Many people were of the erroneous understanding that the best time to shift for maximum acceleration is at peak hp, however the actual answer is based on current torque x current gear ratio compared to shifted torque x shifted gear ratio.   What really stands out to me is that from a peak acceleration perspective, hp has literally no part of this calculation. Which then made me wonder, why on earth do we care about hp then? All you ever hear talk about is hp, and many manufacturers go out of their way to prioritize peak hp over ample torque, especially when designing a race oriented vehicle.  I've watched videos before explaining what hp is and why it matters, but I feel like they always glaze over most of the important details and skip right to the end result.

You might think there\u2019s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called \u201cCommunication in Biology.\u201d It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won\u2019t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can\u2019t suggest something that\u2019s technically illegal (Scihub). I don\u2019t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they\u2019re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we\u2019ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I\u2019m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven\u2019t considered. One thing I will say isn\u2019t going to change my mind: anecdotes of \u201cmy school already teaches this\u201d unless you can show me that it\u2019s already happening in a large number of schools.","__index_level_0__":14850}

I understand that weight could be an issue, but if you divide it up into multiple batteries that weigh no more than say 20lbs each, that would be manageable and allow the average person to be able to change it out (or you could use attendants).

{"post_id":"829eqd","history":"CMV: It is inconsistent to be in favour of banning Russian-sourced political messages from Reddit, and in favour of the principle net neutrality. The value of the principle of net neutrality is that it preserves the internet as a platform for unrestricted communication between people, via restricting what companies are permitted to do with their property.  The only reason to value the principle is if one holds the view that unrestricted communication between people is valuable and that private property rights should be infringed to maintain that value. (It is unnecessary to discuss the merits of censorship here, or whether unrestricted communication is *actually* good.)  I'd briefly like to distinguish between valuing net neutrality out of principle and valuing net neutrality out of pragmatism. If people support it merely because they perceive it as positively affecting information that they want to receive or impart, that is support out of pragmatism. If their primary objection is that they are not the people deciding what gets censored, they do not value net neutrality in principle.  Reddit is analogous to the internet as a whole, and has all the properties of the internet that make net neutrality worth imposing: Its founding purpose was to provide a medium for individuals to communicate on any topic. Setting up an alternative is onerous, due to difficulty of mustering public support. Private interests own the underlying infrastructure.  Russian-sourced political messaging is a form of communication. Under the principle of net neutrality, it would not be slowed, blocked or restricted by an ISP. Ergo, under the principle of net neutrality, it should not be slowed, blocked or restricted by the Reddit administration.  CMV.  For the purposes of giving some background so you can present arguments that align with my values: I personally value freedom of information and communication.

{"post_id":"60rllv","history":"CMV: Donald Trump played the Republican Party and is not a Republican I personally believe President Donald Trump is not a Republican by value, but a Fascist.  I do not throw that word around, and I do not mean it as an insult, I literally mean he is a fascist.     Let me first expose why I don\u2019t believe he is a Republican or has Republican values: 1.\tDonald Trump is \u201cvery pro choice\u201d.  He stated this in an interview in 1999 on Meet The Press. 2.\tDonald Trump has a very limited knowledge of the Bible.  I know this is a stretch, but the GOP in the US has very strong Biblical beliefs, and many of their stances are based around said book (against gay marriage, pro life, etc).  This came to fruition when he mispronounced II Corinthians as \u201ctwo Corinthians\u201d, and even more so when he stated he never asked for forgiveness because he doesn\u2019t do anything bad. 3.\tDonald Trump wants to expand government\u2019s power over it\u2019s citizens, not reduce it.  He stated last year that he\u2019s a fan of Eminent Domain, and is actively using it to acquire land near the Mexican border for his wall.  Through his cutting back of funding for the EPA (which educates and provides regulations that keep air and water more clean), the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor.     My support for him being a fascist: 1.\tHis leaning towards a corporatist economic system.  He is promoting massive tax cuts for wealthy companies, but hardly touching small, 100 employees or less companies.  Removing the restrictions of Dodd-Frank, which protects individuals from predatory lending and collection practices is one such move. 2.\tAttempting to discredit media.  We can all agree that MSM has it\u2019s own agenda, that really isn\u2019t what\u2019s up for discussion here.  What is, however, is his attempt to decide what is \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d news.  He has labeled CNN as \u201cFake News\u201d, while praising Fox and Friends.  He seems to do this not on a basis of fact\/fiction, but on a basis of whether or not they agree with him.  Just yesterday, during the FBI and NSA hearings, he called the hearings \u201cFake News\u201d even though they were literally happening while he was tweeting about it.  He is attempting to claim a monopoly on the truth. 3.\tPower through military.  His budget proposal cuts social welfare programs, environmental protection programs, and education programs to bolster our already large military.   4.\tAttempting to discredit other branches of government.  We all remember that \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT!\u201d tweet he put out as he lost a court battle regarding the banning of people from certain nations, but the courts aren\u2019t the only one.  He has bashed Congress several times over the past few years, and especially during the election.  Claiming the courts are \u201cliberal\u201d (ie. Against what he wants) if they find him wrong, and supporting those that agree with him. 5.\tHis history of alleged sexual abuse.  Mussolini labeled women as \u201creproducers of the nation\u201d and recommended against employing them.  It\u2019s almost as though Trump shares this view and sees them as objects rather than human beings.  Whether it\u2019s walking into the changing rooms at pageants or \u201cgrabbing them by the *****\u201d, or the several allegations of sexual misconduct against him, we have to admit his history with women is a bit rocky at best. 6.\tRacial\/National division.  Trump has repeatedly kicked minorities out of his rallies, including some who claim to have been legitimately there to learn his stances.  His quotes on people from Mexico and Muslims go without saying as well.  \u201cA ban on all Muslims from entering the country\u201d is one of his campaign promises.  Most people will say \u201cMuslim\u2019s aren\u2019t a race\u201d, but let me clarify: a race is just a shared characteristic between groups of people.  It doesn\u2019t have to be physical color.  It can be nationality, religion, skin color, disability, etc. I am posting this here legitimately out of trying to understand where he stands.

Once it's frozen, you throw out all the ice outdoors, and refill the bucket. All the heat that was in the liquid water is now in the house instead, meaning I *must* have gained some free heating.

I believe this is wrong and should be ended. It is unjust to force someone to pay for a child that isn't theirs unless they were in the know to begin with and a legal adoption took place. To that end I believe a negative DNA test should be enough to end any child support obligation and that all paid funds should be returned by the fraudulent mother. As for monetary support of the child that would then be upon the mother to either support the child herself or take the biological father to court to enforce his responsibility.

I've been in the doghouse since July since my boss, the business owner, found out that I was working 8+ hours\/day but not always taking my full (unpaid) lunch hour and leaving early. My coworkers all work varying hours and it was stressed to me that flexibility was normal and expected, but what I was doing was apparently a huge trespass on my boss's generosity and taking advantage of him. I am paid a salary.  This month I asked when a good time would be to take my remaining vacation days and didn't hear back, and we got busy anyway. As the month drew down and it looked like we were going to close over christmas\/new years anyway, I asked if I should request for my vacation days to be held over since there wouldn't be an opportunity to take them. My boss called me into a meeting this week with the other engineers where he announced that he'd changed company policy to forbid holding over vacation days and had cancelled the holiday break, so anyone with remaining vacation days could use them next week. The technicians don't get vacation days and are required to come in.  He told everyone about my nefarious scheme to get extra holidays by holding over my vacation time to next year, and that was taking advantage of him and was damaging to the business, because who would cover in terms of cash and manpower if he was forced to allow employees to take vacation time that had... already been allocated...  The good news is that I got a recording (Canada is one-party consent) that's now on multiple cloud services of him describing how he didn't plan on following our province's employment laws regarding vacation time, and stating that canceling winter break was to retaliate against me for requesting the vacation time offered to me in my employee contract, but in the end I'm feeling really down about this.  Trying to work here has been a drain on my sanity and health, and I've been looking for other employment basically since about 6 months in, but the recruiter calls dried up with COVID. I'm thinking of an interview I had with another forensic engineering firm where they said that their engineers had to handle 20+ active investigations, and that they knew my boss, and I just feel defeated.   I've got a massive industrial investigation going right now and a handful of insurance ones, and the workload is so heavy. I do my own labwork and my boss yells at me if I pass too much to the technicians. I read more papers every few months than I did for my whole masters. We've skirted COVID restrictions so I've still been in the office every day. I have no short term memory and took on 3 prescriptions to try to control all my stress-related illnesses.  How can I manage 20 files and take on full responsibility for the conclusions instead of filtering it through my boss? He shows me all the bad forensic reports that he tears to shreds and tells me about other young engineers who were run out of the industry, and how bad it is at other firms. Yeah, he's doing that to control me, but maybe that is how it is.  Everybody seems to know everybody in this field, and my boss will just tell all his contacts how I screwed him over unfairly. I want to solve these forensic mysteries and help clients, but that might mean letting my boss do what he wants, because I need the experience and references. I'm going to go for a consultation with an employment lawyer, but I'm discouraged because the legal remedy may be at best a small financial payout + getting blacklisted in the industry.  I also keep trying to compose something to send my boss to try to keep the peace until he finally fires me, but it keeps turning into \"hey taintmonger, vacation time per year is guaranteed by law and not something you get to bestow on or snatch away from your employees\".  This a \"woe is me\" post but I'm looking for some perspective from other engineers, which might be \"STFU at least you have a job right now\".

I'm Dr. Lindsay Chervinsky, here to discuss my new book 'The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution' and early Presidential history, AMA!  **The U.S. Constitution never established a presidential cabinet\u2014the delegates to the Constitutional Convention explicitly rejected the idea. So how did George Washington create one of the most powerful bodies in the federal government?**  On November 26, 1791, George Washington convened his department secretaries\u2014Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Knox, and Edmund Randolph\u2014for the first cabinet meeting. Why did he wait two and a half years into his presidency to call his cabinet? Because the U.S. Constitution did not create or provide for such a body. Washington was on his own.  Faced with diplomatic crises, domestic insurrections, and constitutional challenges\u2014and finding congressional help lacking\u2014Washington decided he needed a group of advisors he could turn to. He modeled his new cabinet on the councils of war he had led as commander of the Continental Army. In the early days, the cabinet served at the president\u2019s pleasure. Washington tinkered with its structure throughout his administration, at times calling regular meetings, at other times preferring written advice and individual discussions.  *The Cabinet* reveals the far-reaching consequences of Washington\u2019s choice. The tensions in the cabinet between Hamilton and Jefferson heightened partisanship and contributed to the development of the first party system. And as Washington faced an increasingly recalcitrant Congress, he came to treat the cabinet as a private advisory body to summon as needed, greatly expanding the role of the president and the executive branch.","__index_level_0__":9411}

{"post_id":"kfo857","history":"Is it morally justified to commit suicide? Now, this discussion question is partly a response to Camus\u2019 \u201cThe Myth of Sisyphus\u201d. (For those who are unfamiliar) Here, Camus essentially tries to answer one of the most fundamental philosophical questions: Should I commit suicide? Or in other words: Is life worth living? His answer goes something like this: Yes, life is worth living, but it is your responsibility to find meaning in life, and from that meaning it is your responsibility to find happiness (please refute me if you disagree with this summary).   Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, this single philosophical work has changed my life\u2014it is my Bible. However, I disagree that he answers the question on whether life is worth living. I understand that Camus is partly meaning \u201cphilosophical suicide\u201d; this distinction allows his argument and allegory to be sound. But in the beginning, he specifically meant literally ending your life. Since Sisyphus (a man condemned to push a Boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to fall back down every day) has no option to commit suicide, his only logical option is to simply enjoy his suffering, thus tricking the gods for eternity.   But what if Sisyphus COULD choose to commit suicide (in the Atheist sense) and therefore cease to exist? Would this option disallow\u2014or make it more difficult for\u2014Sisyphus to find meaning and happiness in his suffering?   Additionally, in a practice sense: Do I own my body? If so, why can\u2019t I commit suicide without any moral consequences? Since suicide is illegal, doesn\u2019t that mean that the State owns my body? Furthermore, doesn\u2019t the idea that suicide is selfish even more so indicate that the collective owns my body?","__index_level_0__":9884}
{"post_id":"v9sp51","history":"CMV: The stock market is essentially a well-regulated Ponzi scheme Full disclosure, I have a significant portion of my net worth in stocks, so this view is very much against my self interest.  So the prevailing wisdom is: as an average person, the best thing you can do to protect and grow your wealth is to invest your money in broad market ETFs or mutual funds.  The basic concept is, when you invest in a company, you are buying a piece of that company, and as the company grows and becomes more valuable, the value of your share raises as well.  On the small scale, this concept makes a lot of sense.  For instance, let's say me and a couple friends buy a bakery down the street.  We each own a 30% share in the bakery, and enjoy a 30% share of the profits each month.  When decisions have to be made about the operation of the bakery, the three of us sit down together and have the authority to make a decision.  And probably I can grab a free piece of freshly baked bread whenever I decided to stop by.  But let's say I spend $2k on a share of Google stock.  In which practical way does my \"ownership\" of this portion of the company affect my relationship with Google?  I don't get any privileged access to the data they're collecting.  I don't get priority treatment if I have to contact customer service.    In terms of my relationship with a company, for the average investor the sum total of your involvement with the company is that you get to vote on certain company decisions, where you have basically zero real influence because large interests controlling large portions of the stock have a million more votes than you.  You *might* get a dividend payment, depending on the stock.  But for example, with a company like AAPL, even if they gave a super high dividend of $1 per quarter, it would take like 34 years for one share of AAPL stock to pay for itself.  Your \"investment\" is also not really investing, in the sense of giving a company additional capital with which to grow and improve their business, since you're just buying the share off some other person, and none of that money is going back to the company.  So for all intents and purposes, the only real tangible value of owning a stock for the average person is the promise that it will be worth more to someone else in the future.  So basically, from a logical point of view, there is no real practical difference between a stock or any purely speculative asset, like an NFT or cryptocurrency token or a rare Pok\u00e9mon card.  It's just a piece of paper with a company's name on it, which cannot be meaningfully exchanged for any goods, services or utility.  It's just a piece of paper which hopefully will be worth more in the future.  And this kind of works fine, because assuming that the economy is generally growing over time, which it always has, and assuming everyone keeps buying into it, there will essentially always be a \"greater fool\" in the future who will want that piece of paper, to in turn sell it to an even greater fool down the line.  So it seems to me we've chosen this as a back-handed way of dealing with taking care of retiring people: we tell young working people they have to buy the shares from the old people, so those old people can go off and buy a condo in Florida.  And in turn those young working people trust their stocks are going to be worth something to the young people after them.  So to sum it all up, my view is that the whole stock market, as far as it functions for the average investor, is basically a scheme in which the main function is to transfer money from new investors to old investors, and it's only made sustainable by a steady influx of new investors, much like a Ponzi scheme or any speculative asset bubble.  The only real difference is that society kind of all agreed on the S&P 500 as the socially acceptable Ponzi, so it's kind of works for the most part.  Anyway, that's honestly the conclusion I can come to after trying to make sense of this system.  But it cannot possibly be that stupid, so please go ahead and find holes in my understanding and change my view!","__index_level_0__":15505}

I ask this of anyone and everyone who's in physics.  I'm a physics undergrad student. My interest during my undergrad years has been mainly in particle physics. Up until a few days ago, I was pretty sure that I would keep studying and researching particle physics through a PhD. These past few days I've been having this thought: how is becoming a particle physicist actually going to help people? Even though I want to go into this field of physics that aims to understand the most fundamental particles in the universe, which in and of itself is important to society, how does this actually *help* society? How will it make the world a better place?  I had a friend say to me a few months ago, \"Particle physics is cool, but it's not going to solve global warming, cure diseases, etc.\". I've been thinking more and more about this. It's made me start looking into branches like biophysics, even though I've never even taken a biology class, simply because it uses physics to help us understand ourselves as biological systems. To me, this seems like it would help people more than particle physics.  I've been passive-aggressively telling myself things like, \"Well, omgphysics, why don't you become a doctor instead if you want to help people so badly?\", but I love particle physics and I don't want to stop studying and researching it just because of this dilemma I've found myself in.

After 2 weeks we came across a post on Facebook, a guy was claiming that his 12 year old cat came home after being missing for 2.5 years.  The woman that took the cat, lives 5 doors away from me, she claimed that the cat walked into her house, and she called her ex boyfriend to come and pick up the cat. So she confirmed that she took the cat and gave it away.   Since then we have been in contact with the ex boyfriend, we asked to view the cat as it looked a lot like our cat. At start of our conversation he sent us more pictures of the cat and we were positive it is our cat. So we asked again if we could see the cat, he refused aggressively. But in the end he agreed to meet at the police station, we asked him again to see the cat in person and he accepted, we come to his house and we see that it's 100% our cat.  We also found a photo of the cat that he claims came back to the after 2.5 years of being missing, and it's 12 years old.  We had a verbal agreement to go the vet next day and verify that the cat is not 12 years old and is 18 months old. But he blew us off and started threatening us if we keep contacting him.   That same day a man shows up to our door claiming to be a vet and saying that the ex boyfriend has emotional issues and that he is emotional unstable. The vet then started asking us  if we could leave the cat with him out of good will. We are completely shocked with how unprofessional that \"vet\" was. And he got our address without our consent from the woman that took the cat the vet also confirmed that.   We went to the police but they say their hands are tighed.

However, there is another one I'm waiting on, which is substantially better; longer-period, Ivy-level institution, better geographical location, etc. I'm through to the final round with a 1\/4 chance (I know how many are in the final round and how many get funded), but I won't hear back on that until late May\/early June, whereas the one I have been offered, I would assume I'll have to \"sign\" for fairly soon (within April).

Five years ago my friend received a phone call from a (newly) ex-girlfriend alerting to him that she was pregnant. Being a stand up guy the two got back together and tried to make the relationship work. They stayed together until the baby was born and later split up (within the first year). New Jersey handled the custody and child support hearings. About two years ago the mother moved to Pennsylvania without alerting the court.  Neither mother, nor my friend, live in New Jersey now and the case was never moved. My friend now lives in CA with his new wife and new born son.   Upon seeing his new born he had a gut feeling his 5 year old may not actually be his. On the advice of a lawyer he conducted the paternity test (called a \"peace of mind\" test) and learned he is not the father.   He is devastated but will be pursuing the removal of his name from the birth certificate and the termination of his child support payments.   He is wondering what he can expect through the courts. We've heard terrible stories of men who have been lied to about paternity being held responsible for continued child support payments because the courts like to keep a support system for the child.   The mother is a bit rough. Fresh neck tattoo, knuckle tatts, a single mother, but does have the support of a well-off family. My friend and his wife are living with her (his new wife's) family just trying to make ends meet with their own new child.   They will be hiring a lawyer but want to know what the first steps should be. Does he keep this a secret from the mother(is there a reason) or must he immediately state his findings? Are they in for a big fight (how expensive\/experienced of a lawyer should he be looking to hire). Will the judge for sure order a court appointed paternity test based on his independent finding or could even that be denied? Any chance for repayment of the five years or child support payments? Any reason they should push for the case to be moved from NJ to PA?  Thanks for your help. If there are specific questions that I cannot answer I will get the answers directly from my friend.

While I understand that a defense attorney is there to defend you, I don't see how making it illegal for defense attorneys to say when their client admits to a charge is helping anyone. People will explain this by saying, \"hopefully the courts figure out that he did it anyway, just have trust in the system\". But the system isn't foolproof, and I don't know how defense attorneys can live with themselves knowing that they are defending someone who should be charged with the crime! I don't understand the system at all. Attorneys shouldn't be forced to keep these awful secrets, and we all want the bad guys to get their proper verdict, so why have this rule?  All this rule helps are the bad guys. The good guys aren't benefiting from this, because they (usually) wouldn't admit to something to begin with. This rule is only in place for the sake of \"the system\" and I don't know how good that system is.

I had my gallbladder removed in June due to frequent vomiting and fatigue, it was full of sludge but no stones. The first week and a half I ate maybe four times, and just about a cup of soup. Otherwise I only ingested pedialyte. After that first week and a half, the vomiting reappeared. Since then, I usually vomit at least once a day, no matter what I eat. I've always been pretty health conscious and eat well. I restricted my diet more, still vomiting. Sometimes I don't eat, and once again, vomiting. It's almost always bright yellow\/orange bile, food, or blood. I assume the blood is the stomach acid tearing up my throat. I get dizzy, see what look like shooting stars, and have passed out once.   I have terrible insurance. I'm poor. But I've been able to splurge and see a doctor a couple times. It's always the same answer, \"here's some antinausea\". They don't work. I vomit them back up with bitter bile. I have endometriosis as well, and pediatric onset glaucoma (inherited). I feel like I'm getting weaker, I've lost several pounds recently.

{"post_id":"8thhpl","history":"CMV: Real diversity is the acceptance of anyone, the current debate on diversity is demonstrative of the fact that, overall, we still judge everyone based on what is observable just by looking at them, our goals of diversity are fake, it's just to make things 'look' different. Recently when that woman from Apple resigned after saying that 12 white men in a room could be diverse because of their experiences I had a sudden epiphany for what may be wrong with conversations on diversity these days.  To me, the central issue is that our understanding of diversity is only 'observable' diversity.     I've lived and worked in many different cities, especially those with diverse populations such as Singapore, Doha, New York and London. One thing I've learned is to never assume anything about anyone. That blonde haired blue-eyed guy might be muslim, that calm and married with 3 kids desi lady might ride motorbikes lit on fire on the weekend (true story) - etc. Stereotypes might come from a basis of experience, but I've experienced so many exceptions that mine are a little bit more loosely held than they used to be.     My point is that if our only understanding of diversity is based on what can be initially observed about someone, then what the hell are we really talking about? This person has X colored skin, this person has Y disability, this person has Z political perspective or W religion as seen by an artifact on their body? What the heck? Aren't we better than that? I saw a Japanese woman with a fish bracelet the other day and I thought it was a Jesus fish, but she corrected me and said \"oh I just thought it was a cute fish.\" I think that this entire debate on diversity just shows how overall divided we still are, if people really understood diversity, they would stop talking about what people look like and focus on just ensuring and equal opportunity of success for everyone and combat destructive groups of any kind, regardless of their target.     From my experience, you could dream up the most incredibly diverse board of directors, representing somehow through mixed blood every minority race, religion, disability and personal diet and if they all have the same tactics in common, you'll have a LESS diverse output of strategy from that executive suite. Real diversity is accepting everyone, making things more colorful\/differently shaped is an attempt at a shortcut that ultimately doesn't make sense.

I loathe having to ask this, it feels like the most petty situation on the planet, but it\u2019s becoming a major point of contention among my staff, and as a manager I don\u2019t know how to handle it.   Background: Small non-profit, 10 person staff. Of those 10 staff 9 are females and we share a women\u2019s restroom. It\u2019s a private one toilet with a door restroom.   We have a newer staff member who will go into the restroom for 15-20 minutes at a time 3+ times a day. To the point every time someone else tries to use the restroom she is in there.  At first we though, maybe it\u2019s a temporary thing, not feeling well, etc. However it has not improved, if anything it\u2019s more frequent\/longer times. Other staff members have come to me complaining and more recently started gossiping and complaining to each other about it. Every time we go to look for her to ask her to start a different task she\u2019s in the restroom, and she\u2019ll be in there for extended periods while others need to use it.

Also had me sign a \"receipt for access to vehicle fees\" that turned out to be a damage waiver. Hello, I am fairly sure a towing company that towed my car is violating quite a few civil laws and possibly some criminal ones as well.   &#x200B;  Backstory: Went out of town for \\~2 weeks and parked my truck in the parking lot of the apartment complex where I live (Gated parking with clicker to get in). When I come back in town, truck is missing so I call the number on the \"No Public Parking\" sign and leave a voicemail, which I still haven't heard anything back from. I find some numbers online, and eventually get in contact with a gov't worker who told me that Generic Towing Company Name had my vehicle.   I found their phone number online, and figured that I would have to pay a few hundred and call it a sad day. However, when I called they informed me they wanted over 1500 dollars for the towing\/storage fees since they had towed it apparently only a few days after I had gone out of town. I contacted the building manager of my apartment and they had no idea about any towing (relevant later) .  I then go down to the tow company (located in a whole different city from where I live) and try to prepare myself the best I can with what I want to know\/find out. I read up on  http:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/codes\\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22651.07.&article=1.  and some other readings and then went into the place.   The entire operation reeked of being sketchy. Hand drawn sign with rates and about 3 inches of poly-carb windows on the teller. I asked for a list of the things I owed them this $1500+ for and they refused to give me any bill\/statement of what I owed saying \"Unless you are paying right now, I'm not writing anything down\". I then asked to get my personal items out of my car. They then said there was a $115 \"access fee\" in order for me to walk \\~15 feet to the truck and get my items from within. I also was refused the right to inspect the truck. He also refused to give me any paperwork outlining when\/where\/why it was towed  (he eventually gave me limited amounts of this info after I paid for access to the truck, but initially refused and said it wasn't needed)  All three of these seem to be in violation of the document linked. I said there was laws saying I needed to be able to get my personal items out of the car without fee. They said they didn't care and there was a charge. I needed items from my car so I said I was willing to pay the fee. They then said they needed \"proof of ownership and photo ID\". I said what counts as proof of ownership and they said \"Car title, proof of insurance, or registration\" I informed them all of those were in the car (pretty standard?) glove compartment. They then said they would need a key to the truck as \"proof of ownership\". I said the truck was unlocked so they could retrieve documents without it, but they insisted it was needed to \"verify ownership\". I relented and turned over a key. They retrieved the documents and then allowed me to pay the fee. I asked for a receipt and the guy glared at me then said he needed to write it up. I start loading stuff from the truck into my friends car and then he comes out with my \"receipt\" to sign. I know, I know, I should have been vigilant and not signed it blindly but I did. Turns out what I actually signed was a release of liability for any damages to the truck.   Finally, I ask for the key back. He refuses, saying \"I want verification you were here\". When I brought up I was on his security camera, he said \"thats too much work to get the tapes and all, this is easier\"  &#x200B;  Reading here ( http:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/codes\\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22658. ) it also seems sketch that my landlord\/building manager wasn't contacted because it seems they would have to approve the tow. According to the records I eventually got from the towing company, it was noted at 10am and towed at 9pm, which is far less than the 24-hrs outlined in the link.  &#x200B;  All of this feels and reads to be illegal and sketchy on multiple counts. Please let me know if this is an accurate view and if taking them to civil court would be advisable. Can I threaten to sue unless the fees are brought to something more reasonable or is that unlawful intimidation? I'd honestly be fine paying 500 or something just to make all of this go away.

{"post_id":"x0un63","history":"Why was my wife's pain treated so inadequately after surgery? My (41M) wife (38F) recently had abdominal surgery. I arrived back at the hospital to find her basically overwhelmed with pain the morning after the surgery. She had had no pain relievers administered in almost 11 hours.  She was sobbing, writhing, shaking, with blood pressure 50 points higher than normal. They hadn't given her any opioids overnight, nor had they given her tylenol or NSAIDS.  My limited understanding of pain relief after surgery is that you stay ahead of the pain. You don't let it become overwhelming for the patient. We are trying to figure why this happened, particularly so we can prevent it from happening again. She was semi-traumatized from the experience.  My wife has no history of opioid abuse and in fact has a history of using opioids briefly after other surgeries and then getting off of them quickly with no issue, so opioid abuse should not have been a concern preventing my wife from getting proper care.  What we did figure out is that the process that was in place for pain relievers at this hospital was that my wife was supposed to be asking for them, or they were not going to be given. The nurses kept saying that pain relief was \"PRN\". However neither my wife nor I were ever informed that she would need to be doing the asking or would get nothing for pain and with major abdominal surgery, we had both assumed that the doctors and nurses would be providing for her pain relief so soon after surgery. She did not know to ask and did not realize that she would be absolutely slammed with pain so soon after waking the morning after surgery.  Further, the process in the hospital even after asking for pain relief is that it takes about an hour for the medication to be approved and provided. Even after the oral medication was provided, it would take another hour to become active for her symptoms. So we're talking even after my wife is begging for pain medicine, not knowing she should have to, she would be in growing pain for another two hours.  By the time an oral medication was approved the morning after, my wife was afraid she was gasping and sobbing so hard it would not even be safe for her to attempt swallowing anything and requested an IV pain reliever, but this was initially denied. The nurses told her that she was in this much pain because hadn't peed and she would feel better if she walked and got up to pee, but being up and attempting to walk only increased her pain.  Eventually the doctor arrived to check in and was completely appalled at the state that my wife was in and ordered the IV opioid pain relief. He said that she had been undertreated for pain. In short order after IV opioids, my wife was okay, walking, conversing, peeing and sitting up.  We are left with questions about why this happened. This is a hospital with a good reputation in a major metropolitan area. Do I need to just plan on being with my wife every second if she has any future surgeries so that I can protect her? Should we just avoid this hospital? Is the way that pain relief was provided related to systemic concerns about preventing opioid addiction that we might encounter in other hospitals as well? Why on earth would pain medication be PRN so soon after abdominal surgery and why would no one tell us? Why didn't they at least provide some ibuprofen on a schedule? How can we prevent this from happening in the future and is there any particular person at the hospital we can talk to communicate that how they handled this was highly problematic and is likely to be highly problematic for other patients as well?","__index_level_0__":6648}
{"post_id":"avucfz","history":"CMV: anti-quantitative biases are pervasive in the humanities and are based on a straw-man conception of quantitative methods For context, I'm in the humanities but do quantitative research in that area (applied computational linguistics). I'm trying to gauge how representative my experience of how quantitative methods are generally viewed by traditional humanities scholars is.  Basically, it seems like there is a general distaste for quantitative methods, stemming from a few sources.   First, quantitative methods are aligned with capitalism, patriarchy, and are overhyped by zelous quants who are mostly men. I can understand an association between power and quantification - it's very useful on many levels, so it's not surprising that those in power use it. But I don't see that as a barrier to using quantification for other goals and interests. In other words, an association between quantification and power is an accident of history, not something essential to quantification itself.  Second, quantitative methods have limited applicability to humanistic goals and questions. I agree it has limits. But I feel like I encounter assertions about these limits that don't make sense. Like someone saying \"I don't know how to measure fear\" ignoring the immense amount of cognitive science on measurement and conceptualization of affect. Or, statements that quantitative methods can't be intersectional because they must treat variables (like race and sexual orientation) as independent - which is just plain wrong. It's trivial to run two models with y = f(x) + f(z) and y = f(x, z) and test which model is better.   Or, legitimate limitations of a quantitative method are treated as insurmountable. Examples I've seen include peopling acting as if time series analysis doesn't exist, mixed-models don't exist, or non-linear models don't exist. Basically outright ignorance of how flexible modern statistical methods are leads to a fatalistic attitude towards the capabilities of quantitative methods.  Likewise, quantitative researchers are believed to be less thoughtful about their methods than they really are. Basically ignoring how much scientists think deeply about underlying issues in interpreting and presenting data, and never acknowledging perspectives like this: https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http:\/\/www.stat.columbia.edu\/~gelman\/research\/published\/gelman_hennig_full_discussion.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi8gIy-hN_gAhVFYKwKHVyRAt0QFjAAegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw3Oe2f-yaRLIEQ-LI0s4sof   Now, I know there are plenty of dudebros who wield the word \"objectivity\" like a verbal cudgel in debates - but these guys are your average internet commenter, and don't represent the depth to which my quant colleagues understand their methods.  My perception is that these sorts of ignorant anti-quantitative attitudes are widespread. I'm hoping I'm wrong and my view is distorted by either my biases or the pecularities of my experience.

The area also gets stiff\/tense\/sore but I can't do anything to help it. I've only had one professional massage before but the guy asked me \"how long I've had sciatica\" (I wasn't aware I did), noted the extreme muscle spasms when trying to touch that area, and also noted that my glutes were spastic when manipulated too.

I was being considered for many other postdoc positions and fellowships, but, given the job market being as awful as it is right now, I accepted the postdoc position. They gave me 3 days to give them an answer, which also didn't help me think through all of my options. The job was in Japan, and I'm based in Europe, for context.  As I expected, I got rejections for most postdoc positions, which validate my decision of accepting the postdoc in Japan. That is, until last week. Then, last week, I received the great news that my fellowship proposal would be funded. This is a great opportunity - the department is full of experts in my field (which isn't the case in Japan), the fellowship allows me to work on my own ideas (while in Japan I would be working for someone else), and the fellowship is supposed to pave the way for a permanent position.

{"post_id":"1g7gdk","history":"Can someone explain contemporary race laws and race-based policies in North America (USA and Canada), such as affirmative action and tax exemption for native Americans? Why are these laws not considered racist\/discriminatory? (Not intended to be inflammatory, respectful discussion please) I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, so please shoot me down if I'm ruining your wonderful sub (although if you could point me in the right direction first, I'd greatly appreciate it).  My question is not intended to be racist or inflammatory, and at the risk of sounding condescending I'd like to plead for discussion to be civil and for upvotes etc. to be alloted by reason rather than emotion. I'd also like to clarify that I am not North American, but recently visited a relative of mine in Canada and learnt, in broad strokes, about the race laws there. I'd like to share the experience as it adds context to my question; feel free to skip to the end to see my question on its own.  I visited my cousin when he got married in Toronto. He's white and Irish (1st gen immigrant), and his girlfriend is also white, originally from the Ukraine. They had lived there for about 10 years. She worked as a teacher on a Native American (or American Indian, I'm afraid I don't know what term is appropriate, apologies if I cause offense) reservation (I think she used a better name for it, apologies again). I was quite surprised by many things I learnt. According to her, many people in the native community are exempt from various taxes, and receive free education up to and including University (unlike other Canadians in that prefecture), and also benefit from various other favoritist policies based on race. However, to qualify for the full benefits (which could include ownership of land), you had to be at least n% American Indian - if your bloodline was too watered down, you no longer qualified.  I was quite surprised by this, because it didn't seem fair at all. First of all, there's something a bit grim about your birth (and your % indigenous blood) determining your relationship to the state etc.; I like to think that in a developed country, the law, rights, and duties should apply to all equally regardless of race. I was also distressed by my relative's reaction to my surprise. They reasoned that since they were white, it was fair - they'd oppressed the Indians in their own day, and it was time to pay reparations. However, this argument didn't make sense to me. First of all, many taxpayers (who are footing the bill for indigenous privilege) are non-white. They might be Japanese Canadians, who were hideously mistreated very recently, or just recent immigrants from China or Bangladesh who've never done anything wrong to the indigenous people. I also pointed out that a Ukrainian and an Irishman have also probably done nothing wrong (historically speaking) - heck, almost no-one suffered so much at the hands of the British as the Irish, and Ukraine hasn't exactly had a fun 150 years either. Finally, I pointed out that really, guilt shouldn't be inherited, and race laws don't really have a place in a first world country.  My relatives reaction is what surprised me the most, and what lead me to ask this question. They became very defensive and actually angry at me. I honestly felt as if they'd been brainwashed. I must admit, I don't understand the Canadian educational system at all, but it seems like it's trying to make people feel guilt - or worse, actually BE guilty - of crimes they have not committed. What is also strange is that they objected to my use of the term 'race law' in reference to laws which specifically stipulate different treatment by the law based on race.  I am given to understand that the USA has similar policies, for instance permitting Native Americans to circumvent various state and federal laws, again based on bloodline (Casinos spring to mind).  I was surprised to discover that Canada and the USA have different legal treatment for different races, and I have the impression that mainstream society doesn't question this much. Am I correct in that impression? What is the discussion in the field of social science of the validity of having 'preferred' races, 'tax exempt' races, etc.? Doesn't serious social science frown upon 'race' as a construct anyway, and if so, why hasn't that attitude permeated society as a whole? Finally, is opposing such policies considered racist?  TL;DR: Explain race laws in Canada and the USA, affirmative action, and social attitudes towards the same; please remain civil! (although obviously if you think I'm a monstrous racist, please tell me! I'm moving to the USA soon and want to be careful not to offend anyone in that country.)

I have seen a lot lot of backlash against women in the Women's March who carry signs relating to their pussy (such as \"Stay Out of My Pussy\") and wear pink pussy hats. (I personally find pink pussy hats silly but that is neither here nor there). The backlash has been in the form of fb statuses, tweets, and think pieces that claim that talking about a pussy as a part of your experience of womanhood is trans exclusionary.  While I agree that not all woman have vaginas and not all people with vaginas are women I don't think it is fair to tell someone that what makes them personally feel like a woman is false. Every woman has different things that make them connect with the idea of being a woman (some are choices and some aren't). Some women feel that their long hair makes them feel womanly while some women with short hair say their short hair brings out their feminine features. Same can be said for wearing make up or not. When it comes to bodies some women with thin waistlines say that makes them feel like a woman while some women with curves feel like their curves are part of their womanly identity.   I don't think there is anything wrong with a woman feeling like her pussy or the fact that she can give birth is part of what makes her feel connected to the word woman as long as she recognizes that not all women have vaginas or the ability to give birth and they are still just as much of a woman as she is. After all I have heard from some trans women that their penis feels like part of their personal womanhood and that is acceptable too.  It is impossible to connect all women with a single trait other than their shared identity of describing themselves as women. Why can't having a vagina, which is a trait shared by 99% of women, be an acceptable thing to connect with other women about?   The female reproductive system is treated unfairly by the government. Saying that doesn't mean I don't agree that healthcare for trans women (and men) is also unjust. This backlash feels like their saying \"the injustices of my group are worse than yours therefore your injustices shouldn't be fought for.\"  I think it is important for feminism to be intersectional, I just also think is is ok to accept that everyone identifies the way they do for their own specific and personal reasons. Doing so doesn't mean they don't accept you for having your own different or even contradictory personal reasons for sharing that label.

But, the culture surrounding it, both inside clinical settings and on the internet, doesn't help people. It creates a culture of diagnosis, over actually helping people. It treats mental illness in a very medicalized way, when mental and physical illnesses shouldn't be viewed in the same way. They should be viewed with the same amount of respect. On the internet, specifically amongst teenagers, but not always, it becomes diagnosis olympics. I fell into this trap as a teenager, of becoming fascinated by what I could potentially have, as well as mental illnesses in general. Nothing wrong with that, looking into the mind is fascinating, but looking into it through that lens can lead to problems. It's not even people self-diagnosing that's necessarily the issue, cause sometimes people just know themselves, but rather viewing the mental illness as the explanation to all their problems. People behave as if these labels came before their actual experiences, when it's the opposite. Nothing really changes when you get diagnosed, people just feel comforted by it, because it is human nature to want to categorize things. I think a diagnosis can be helpful in understanding how to treat someone, and give them context into what's going on, but it's not the full picture by any means. In psychiatric hospitals, this is especially an issue, in which diagnosing people becomes the priority over actually helping them, so that people can be given meds, then sent away, since there's not enough space, and everyone is emotionally burnout (I know, that's a simplified view of what's going on).","__index_level_0__":16215}

{"post_id":"me3lz3","history":"How do rationalists ground their belief in the values of their logical system? I was watching the 2018 conversation between Jordan Peterson and Matt Dillahunty.  The conversation got to a point where Dillahunty was describing his (and Sam Harris') rational morality system.  From my understanding, in this system they contend that societal\/personal \"wellbeing\" can be reduced to a set of axioms, and rational analysis can be applied to these axioms to maximize \"wellbeing\".  This seems quite logical to me.  However, a conflict occurred when Dillahunty implied that the axioms themselves can be derived through rational analysis.  Peterson pushed back on this notion, infamously asking \"how do you know chopping off your head is bad for your wellbeing?\" Dillahunty replied saying if we are acting from the assumption of maximizing some aspect of life, then avoiding death is inherent in the maximization problem.  This again seems perfectly logical to me.  But I believe Peterson's skepticism can be applied again: why should we attempt to maximize wellbeing?  More generally, I see the problem as this: a logical system (rationality) can be used to maximize some function (wellbeing) given a set of initial axioms (wellbeing is good).  I have no concerns with this logical formulation.  However, a skeptic can always question the axioms.  The usual reply from a rationalist is that \"most can agree that wellbeing is good\", but this is an argument ad populum, which may be sufficient from a practical standpoint, but cannot be used as definitive proof of the initial axiom.    So my question: a rationalist claims to only hold beliefs when evidence supports the claim.  However, as the skeptic digs deeper it seems that there is some core value beliefs taken on faith that shapes the derived logical system.  How does the rationalist justify this core belief taken on faith, and if not, how can this discrepancy be reconciled?","__index_level_0__":10066}

I've been taking him to the vet for months now.  6 1\/2 year old border collie mix. We live in southern Wisconsin. He has two perfectly healthy doggie siblings.  He started last October with just not being his happy hungry self, so vet expressed his anal glands.  He continued to not eat much, appetite comes and goes. He started to yelp when we would pet him, but every few days the spot with pain would change.  He had stool and urine samples, blood tests, x-ray and ultrasound. Nothing conclusive. Sometimes protein levels would be high, sometimes they weren't. Sometimes he had bacteria, sometimes he didn't.  He started getting open sores, crusty spots, fur falling in clumps, random lumps under his skin. Some seemed to be by his lymph nodes, one was along his spine.  He is NOT itching, and only occasionally does some licking. Scrapings taken from spots and biopsy of lumps. No mites, no obvious reason for the sores and scabs. Biopsy inconclusive. They couldn't rule out lymphoma, but there was nothing strongly indicating it.  He does have a low grade fever and high white blood cell count.  There are new sores popping up on a daily basis. I'm currently waiting on results from \"better\" tests.  We've done two kinds of antibiotics with no improvement. Other than that, pain pills that don't really seem to help.  My poor guy lays around all day.  Sometimes he'll go out for a walk and at least forget about his pain for a little bit. But yeah, if you looked at the pics, you can see he's in agony.  Please, I hope someone can figure this out!   (If I can get the actual test details, I'll post those.)","__index_level_0__":14291}

His tweets and scandals suggest that he either lacks the intelligence or mental\/emotional stability to control himself so the scandals and problems will continue to dog his administration. This has been evident for over a year. We know that Trump is a liar and a conman and his supporters chose him to make government more effective. This strange decision is the result of poor education, misleading media and willful ignorance that will not change anytime soon.  Trump could continue to make mistakes, say controversial things, fail to pass changes to immigration or healthcare and pass a normal Republican budget. He could oversee a damaged economy and failing international security situation. He could make no major changes to the US government aside from embarrassing it and weakening the country but his supporters will continue to support him no matter what.

{"post_id":"p5479x","history":"Property law: my mom is being sued by the guy who bought her house from the guy who bought her house South Dakota. My dad owned the same house for over 40 years. He owned it before he married my mom and she inherited it when he died. A few years after he died, she decided to move to where my sister lives and put the house up for sale.  Guy suing (calling him A-hole1) is a complete psychopath who has lived in the neighborhood 20+ years and everyone hates him. There are a thousand things we could talk about with him but the important bits are he\u2019s a lawyer (not actually practicing) and a doctor (who lost privileges at the local hospital for being a psychotic asshole but not his license somehow and is still in private practice). So, he\u2019s got a shitload of money and knows the law and also has bought up pretty much every other lawyer in town.  He\u2019s also been methodically buying up every property he can in my mom\u2019s neighborhood and turning them into rentals, subdividing lots and building more rentals, and basically doing his best to take over and ruin what was some very premium real estate right next to a national park.  When my mom\u2019s house went up for sale, he immediately showed up on her doorstep (literally a couple of hours after it posted), and offered her her asking price in cash. She told him she\u2019d think about it, because it freaked her out and she didn\u2019t know quite what to do, and she said he was visibly pissed when he left.   My mom isn\u2019t stupid, but she has never bought or sold a property in her entire life, so she relied heavily on her realtor. The realtor told her she could definitely wait on A-hole1\u2019s offer and see if anyone else wanted to go higher. She then got a higher offer and took it\u2014but, rather mysteriously, that offer fell through under some weird circumstances and my mom didn\u2019t have a buyer anymore. She had closed on her new house already, so she was even more freaked out and wanted to hurry up and sell even though my sister and I told her to calm down and wait.  She then got an offer from a guy who\u2019s a lawyer and on the city council (A-hole2). It was for more than her asking price, and *he waived an inspection and a survey* and just bought the place. So my mom took it and moved.  Now, the trouble comes from a detached garage my dad had built. He owned several acres so there were lots of spots to build this thing, but he decided to put it off the end of the driveway. He had a professional contractor come build it, and while my mom had almost no input, she says a survey was done it make sure it was far enough from the neighbors\u2019 property to be okay.   The properties have no distinct borders; it\u2019s just a big meadow, no fence line or obvious markers. Also the neighbors are life-long friends of my parents so if there had been an issue it would have probably been easy to solve. Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it\u2019s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it\u2019s not encroaching on anything, and we don\u2019t have to cross the property line to access it).   But my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad\u2019s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it\u2019s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don\u2019t think so.  Anyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. *He\u2019d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.*  A-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she\u2019d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he\u2019d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that\u2019s why A-hole2 hadn\u2019t done the survey.  She got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1\u2019s lawyer that they knew she hadn\u2019t been dishonest and they just hoped she\u2019d \u201cpitch in\u201d to move the garage like she\u2019d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).  So, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again.   My mom got a summons served to her new house; again she\u2019s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can\u2019t control and that\u2019s another topic) so she doesn\u2019t ever just open the door.   She saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn\u2019t; she told the person she didn\u2019t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.  My mom\u2019s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (*coincidentally*\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he\u2019s bought every firm on this side.  So\u2026 my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer.   How worried should she be? How can I help her?","__index_level_0__":18308}

{"post_id":"gllq6a","history":"CMV: The current US bailouts for all the large companies is unfair to both the US taxpayers, small businesses, and every company that responsibly managed their money in recent years Recently, the US government has given out trillions in bailouts to the airline, retail, hospitality, etc industries. However, as a tax payer, I'm outraged that these large corporations are getting these handouts from the government and getting rewarded for their greedy behavior. The bank bailouts of 08 made me sick and I can't believe we're doing this again. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes due to the bank's irresponsible and illegal behavior, and yet all these bankers made out with millions.  Take the airline industry for example. 96% of their Free Cash Flow was spent on stock buybacks this past decade. These C-suite executives and investors made millions off this type of behavior despite not creating any type of value for both the company and for their employees. If your company can't last a few months of stagnant revenue, you shouldn't be spending all that money on buybacks and dividends. Especially when a large reason these companies found so much excess money in the last couple years was an egregious gifted tax cut from the government. Sure no one could have foreseen the current environment, but nearly every economist was predicting a recession within the next few years. They should have prepared for some type of downturn.   Furthermore, this punishes the companies that actually acted responsibly with their capital. In normal circumstances, this would be their opportunity to gain market share and even buy up some of the failing companies. Instead, they are robbed of this opportunity. The way our market works is that feedback is all seen through the lens of risk and reward. When a company decides to spend almost all of their profits on buybacks, they are taking the risk that a black swan event in the future can cause bankruptcy. Now we are removing the incentive for prudent decision making for companies. What's to stop companies of only acting recklessly since they know the government will always bail them out?  Lastly, lots of small businesses are going bankrupt everyday. Where are their bailouts? Why should large companies with every advantage in the world be given this lifeline for acting so irresponsibly, when normal everyday people struggling to get by are not allotted this same opportunity.  Before anyone says it, I understand bailouts are not free money. They're a loan by the government. But the interest rates are typically much lower than they would command in the free market. The government should either charge a high interest rate to compensate for that risk, or inject money into these companies through equity investments that could be put in a blind trust. At least in this scenario, the bailout is seen through the lens of a prudent investment. It's also pricing in the risks of investing in these companies since we never know what will happen to them in the future. If they don't want it, they can find someone else to give them money or go bankrupt. It's not like these companies will just disappear, there will be a buyer somewhere out there.   No one is ENTITLED to a low interest loan from the government, especially these mega corporations who barely pay above minimum wage for their lowest employees while constantly upping the C-suite's compensation. By handing out bailouts that actually reflect the risk for these companies, we can actually punish the C-Suite and investors who squeezed every bit of profit out of the company during good times since these deals will negatively affect the stock price. The bailouts in its current form reward the CEOs and investors who already cashed out in the past couple of years pushing for buybacks and increased dividends.","__index_level_0__":14513}

Houses in most major metros where most of the U.S. population lives, housing prices are increasing at rates faster than what incomes can keep up with. This is causing a lot of financial hardship; especially among young workers and working class people, to the point it is locking out an entire generation and class of people out of home ownership. Furthermore, I only see overwhelming incentives to keep prices high, and for those prices to keep increasing. I don't think I'll ever be able to afford a house in my lifetime, or at least not for a few decades. Here are the reasons why  1. Rich Foreign buyers are buying up property and out competing people who reside in local economies 2. Real Estate Investment Trusts and Big Banks within the U.S. are also out competing people residing in local economies 3. Older Generations are opposing any and all forms of urban density that would increase housing supply in a meaningful amount to lower prices. 4. The U.S. Population keeps increasing; but the land the U.S. has is finite. Most land that is easily assessable to most people living in urban centers is already developed. 5. Wages continue to stagnate despite increased housing costs; furthering the gap. 6. Materials to build homes and laws\/regulations for lot sizes make it expensive to build homes; therefore the homes and condos being built are \"luxury\" properties.  I'm bummed out that houses will probably never come back down in my lifetime.","__index_level_0__":15825}

He is neutered. There is also a 7 year old female Calico in the house that he mostly ignores, except for a daily grooming sessions & sharing naps in the sunlight. His medical history is virtually non existent, except for an extended stay at the vet after being neutered because the incision wouldn\u2019t stop bleeding & then he got a secondary infection. Also, my ex would blow marijuana smoke in his face numerous times for a couple of years, without my knowledge of course.  The problem we\u2019re having is that within the past 5 years his behavior has become extreme & annoying. He had to have 4-5 teeth pulled about 3 years ago, so we feed him wet food. But he cries for food all day. We have to feed him sometimes 5 x a day because he will not stop howling & following us until we do, & when we got to give him more wet food, we realize he\u2019s barely eaten the previous serving of food. He likes the food, we\u2019ve tried other brands & he won\u2019t eat them at all. This brand he likes, but it\u2019s almost like he forgets he still has food or he won\u2019t eat but a few bites at a time & then it sits out for 30 minutes & he wants fresh fresh food? We can\u2019t figure out a way to feed him so that he is satisfied & we get terrorized in the process. The other issue is that he howls *constantly*. He will go into a room in the house, get in a corner facing the wall & do this really deep howling meow repeatedly. It is literally driving us insane. He\u2019s woken up our 18 month old twins multiple times. He has learned to stand outside their nursery & howl because we\u2019ll definitely give him more food to avoid waking them up, although he does this unrelated to food as well. I don\u2019t know if he has anxiety or behavioral issues or if he is unhappy, but let me repeat, he is literally driving us bonkers. He\u2019s never been a chill cat. He was bouncing off the walls crazy as a kitten & young cat, then adulthood into senior years, even before the babies, he began acting this way with the howling & going crazy stalking us for more food constantly. He\u2019s been to the vet in the past year for a general check up, although my husband didn\u2019t mention any of this to the vet. Can anyone tell me what seems to be going on here?

{"post_id":"2m5lkb","history":"Change my view thatIf left-anarchist modes of production were truly superior, then more people would already be using them. My understanding is that the basic idea behind anarchism is that productive property (capital) should not be owned by individuals, but should be held in common by the people who work on it through a co-op or similar arrangement.  Anarchists seem to believe that the workers will be inspired to create systems that are more efficient, more humane, and all-around superior to those of capitalist businesses.  My question is, if you want to work at a collectively owned business, then what's stopping you from starting one?  There's no law against it.  True, capital doesn't come out of thin air, but raising money for such a venture is a far more realistic goal than overturning the entire socio-political system.    There are already employee-owned businesses, and while they have their advantages, they are not nearly as revolutionary as many anarchists seem to believe their co-ops would be.  If they were more efficient, innovative, etc, they would out-compete traditional businesses in the market.  In fact, you don't even need to be part of a commune to \"own the means of production\".  You just need to invest in the company you work at, and then you'll get your share of the profits of capital.  Most people are reluctant to do this, because they understand at some level that capitalists do not make money by doing nothing, they make money by taking risks.  Many people do not want to share in the risks of their workplace, with good reason.  In the current system, we have the choice between two systems.  Anarchism would force everyone into the system that the majority of people do not choose.  I do not see how this can be considered a good thing.  Please CMV. _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

So our government believes it is just, and is attempting to defend spying on its own citizens. They're actively trying to disarm us. There's inevitably another thousand other things like this happening that we DON'T yet know about. Our president has outright admit that the only thing more important than Constitutionally protected freedoms is the premise of 'safety'.  So who's going to do anything about it? Americans are too comfortable to get up and care. Everywhere else in the world, this kind of behavior by the government would have mass riots in the streets, huge anti-government demonstrations, petrol bombs, tear gas, riot police, gunfire, and serious attempts to destabilize the ruling regime. These protests and riots go on for *weeks*.  What are we going to do about it? We've been driven into left\/right factions so thoroughly that we've crippled ourselves. No matter the issue, we've been trained from an early age to think a certain way and almost dehumanize the other. If left-leaning people start rioting, the right will be able to easily dismiss them as just jobless whining hippies. If the right-leaning people start rioting, they will be dismissed as crazy gun-nut rednecks. Any attempt to do anything as a unified whole will be sabotaged by the lines our own politicians have probably deliberately drawn in the sand. There isn't a single issue I can think of where 'left' and 'right' agree, there *always* has to be an opposing view.  Additionally, our country is so big and decentralized that we don't even know WHERE TO BEGIN. How do people in Nevada, Washington state, Montana show their discontent? How does voting even change anything anymore? The two parties have infected the system down to the core. Who are you going to vote for?

Rather than just a few people standing in a park, it's the entire state of Texas, or Arizona, or Utah that's part of it. And it would demand prompt action on behalf of the federal government, rather than just ignoring the protests as they usually do until the local police abuse the protestors enough that they eventually go home. The bottom line is that protesting doesn't work anymore. It hasn't worked since the 50s.  This would also change the rules of the game - rather than the government being able to do what it wants and it being up to the citizens to respond to it, now the government would have to respond instead. And depending on what they do, it could bring the entire system down.  I don't think secession could actually happen for reasons I stated before - left\/right politicians are a gangrenous rot on our political system and would sabotage this effort on every level, and ignorant left\/right people would sabotage each other... but if it were possible, I believe it should be done now, and sooner rather than later.  Am I wrong?","__index_level_0__":16260}

Hello everyone, I\u2019m not sure if this has been asked yet or it\u2019s even relevant but I have been thinking about this for some time and would like your input. I\u2019m not an engineer, but I\u2019m curious if those of you who are think of how things actually get built by the labourers and tradesmen on site. Just as an example I\u2019m in shallow utility construction and I am often perplexed at who the hell thought of designing an electrical system the way the did. A lot of the time it seems like the person drawing up the plans for a project just wants to make things difficult for us. I know that there are regulations and that things are designed the way they are for a reason, and that it\u2019s not just engineers but inspectors, pm\u2019s and everyone in between who needs to do their job so that the project can be completed safely and properly however arduous the task may be once everyone has added their two cents. Do engineers think about how hard something will actually be to build and attempt to make things easier for the guy on the ground, or is it all function in the end?   Ps. This isn\u2019t a dig at engineers, I\u2019ve got nothing but respect for what you people do to keep the world running.","__index_level_0__":7022}

My mom (61 f) who has been battling stage 4 breast cancer since 2015, was told 4 weeks ago her liver wasn\u2019t responding to the chemo and the tumors were increasingly growing. They quickly changed to a new chemo in hopes that it responds well to the liver tumors- but no luck. The bilirubin numbers were high, starting at 2.1, then 4.9 a a week later, and a 11.2 the following week. I was told there is nothing else we can do. No more chemo, no radiation. Her liver is failing. I asked about clinical trials, liver transplant, and immunotherapy- all which I was told she doesn\u2019t qualify for due to the Mets spread to her bones, lungs and brain as well. She had brain surgery a year ago to remove a tumor and was told she had leptomeningeal disease. But that improved with intrathecal injections + cyber knife radiation.    Hospice was the only option other than taking her home regularly with a home health aide. Which was not enough support in my opinion with her current state. I chose hospice after hearing the recommendation of two oncologists (including her regular oncologist) and 3 ER doctors. I feel guilty for choosing this option. She\u2019s at home and for the past 3 days now she\u2019s been mostly asleep. Barely speaking. I\u2019m so scared. Every time I give her morphine I feel immense guilt.

Especially during a period when women held little political power in their own right and a substantial portion of marriages were basically loveless?  Would these alliances have been weaker in the absence of a marriage? Why? Didn't people break them when convenient all the time anyway?

It seems like episodes are less likely to happen in situations where I am anxious. I'm thinking that has something to do with raised blood pressure. There are more symptoms which I listed out in my second post.  **Since my last post**:  * I had a neurologist that decided I have conversion disorder after he couldn't find anything else wrong  * I decided it was worth it to wait for a top neurologist to see me. That neuro did not think it was psychiatric.  * That neuro decided to send me to a Thoracic Surgeon to test for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome for the 4th time because he said that he knew one person who would perform the test and would produce reliable results since most people don't properly test for it.  These were his thoughts:  > It sounds like a vascular issue to me. Thoracic outlet is certainly in the nix and we will test it by ultrasound 01:12 . If negative, we will do a tilt-table to look for dysautonomia and then finally may look at the cervical occipital instability. She had a flexion and extension MRI that showed some findings, but we may need to get her to see a local neurosurgeon who has an expertise on that. I doubt she is having epilepsy.  * Test for TOS came back positive, meaning 2\/4 prelim. tests I have done for TOS have come back positive  * Did more tests  **Diagnosis**: Suggestive of mild-moderate venous thoracic outlet syndrome on the right and equivocal mild venous thoracic outlet syndrome on the left.  They also found a small hyper enhancing lesion on my liver which they are going to do an MRI of later, but it is most likely just a benign flash-filling hemangioma so I'm not worried about it.  So now that **I have a diagnosis** you may be wondering, **what is the problem?**   #**My diagnosis doesn't fit all my symptoms**  Specifically, my problems with lapses in consciousness.   I wanted to hear your thoughts on what underlying 2nd condition there may be if there is one.  I recorded some videos where I induce episodes. I accidentally hit my head in two of the videos, but I didn't know that I did until I watched the videos. I also had some memory loss of immediately before and after each episode.   Note that these episodes are what I was classify as mild-moderate. I frequently have more severe ones but they only really get severe when they catch me off guard.  In each video you will note there is a lag between when I turn my head and the visible symptoms occur. During this time frame one or both eyes are going blind, either partially or fully.  #**Videos:** Where I hit my head:  https:\/\/youtu.be\/Uhh8IfT9qb8  https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZBv9uVBed3w  Where I don't hit my head:  https:\/\/youtu.be\/WwwnYFYrfhU  https:\/\/youtu.be\/Hcp6u9ciX3c  https:\/\/youtu.be\/sXGE847b9QI  https:\/\/youtu.be\/H87RnuA4rqk  If you want to know about what tests I have taken or if you would like clarification on anything just ask!

The background to my story is someone ruined my cousin's life and drove her to suicide. My cousin was given guardianship of her friend's son after her friend and her husband died. This person planted drugs in the car and garage and called the police and CPS about it and she was charged and child was taken into foster care, did something to the deed of her condo and it was stolen from her and sold, lied about things she did at work to her fired, hacked into her computer and planted disgusting porn involving children and alerted the police about that, impersonated her at the bank and stole all her money and hit my cousin with a motorcycle leaving her badly injured. After all of this my cousin committed suicide. Months after this the actions started to come unraveled when footage from a camera showed the bike speeding away (with a plate registered to the person) and the person was caught receiving a tax return in my cousins name.  Everything came out eventually. This person was arrested and jailed for everything she did to my cousin and for other crimes related to marijuana and obstructing justice. I have done my best to move on. This was over a decade ago. The person's parents have begun to do to me what I believe is harassment. Same to other members of my family, including my 90 year old grandmother who is in a retirement home. The person who hurt my cousin has cancer. Her parents want us to forgive her before she dies. They have come to my house in person 9 times, sent me 15 letters, had 2 different lawyers send me letters asking me to meet with this person in jail while she is still \"well\". I have had over 30 phone calls from them, I have been visited by someone claiming to be a minister and also received a letter from him telling me to forgive and one of her parents has come to my job 3 times. They visited my 90 year old grandmother 4 times before we made it with the home that they have to stay away. They have also went to see my teenage niece at the bus stop outside of her school (she was just a baby when this happened) and visited my brother over a dozen time at his job and sent him a bunch of letters. They stood in front of my aunt and uncles car and blocked them in their driveway and only left when my aunt started dialing the police.  We want them to leave us alone. I don't care if their daughter has cancer and none of us want to meet or forgive her. Her parents have not been violent or threatening but my family has been through enough.

We have seen some absolutely amazing gastronomic discussions here, and hope you continue to provide the community with such helpful and thoughtful conversations.  With the rate of growth we have had the past few months, we feel it is necessary to make a few changes, reiterate some points and get the communities feedback on a few issues. The goal of these potential changes is to provide everyone with a better experience in our community. **We want to hear all of your feedback on these issues.**  Our main concern is about some of the questions that are being submitted.  * **Recipe based question**s - If you refer to our current rule #5 located in our sidebar, you can see that not every recipe based question is encouraged here. **We are not Google.** If you simply need ideas for a piece of meat, or want to know a great pie recipe, you will most likely get many great answers through google, or even other sub reddits. \/r\/cooking, \/r\/food or \/r\/recipes are all options. However, we understand there are some recipe based questions that are more uncommon, and harder to find legit answers, and in that case, you may post here. Think of \/r\/askculinary as the last resort. Questions like [this, this and this are not desirable here. Questions like this and this are fine however. Notice the difference in the quality of the question. The OP provides much more background and information in the posts that are well written. The more specific you can make a recipe\/ingredient based question, the better.  * **Discussion based questions** - This sub reddit and community was created to help people become a better cook, and to increase your culinary knowledge. If a post has little to do with cooking, and would not help others with the answers, we feel this is not accomplishing our original goal. Questions like these three(#1, #2, #3) are not very appropriate here. Perhaps \/r\/KitchenConfidential is better. That being said, posts like this and this, are completely fine. Basically, if the answers to the question being asked would help the community in their culinary adventures, it is fine. **If it is just to share war stories and what not, we feel these do not fit in here.**  * **Question and comment formatting** - **With every question you ask, please be sure to give as much detail as possible.** The more detail you can give us, the better we can help you. Conversely, the more through you can be in your responses and comments, the better. Try to avoid those one or two word comments, make it as thorough as you can. We are aware that this is not always possible or necessary, but try and make your posts as thoughtful as possible. Good post, not so good post. Great post, not so great post.  * **Reposting, search function and FAQ** - **Please utilize the search function, and our FAQ before posting.** There are quite a bit of posts made that are extremely similar to each other that could be easily answered without reposting. We are in the works of possibly updating our FAQ, as well as updating some CSS coding. This will be done to remind the community of what is appropriate and give them some helpful resources.  This about sums up all of our ideas and issues that have been expressed by ourselves, and the community. **So I ask you r\/askculinary, what are your thoughts on these issues? How do you feel about these potential changes?** We would love to heat all of our feedback regarding the future of this community.

He isn't stupid or aggressive but, he doesn't like being pet on by random strangers unless I've given consent. He wont bite but, he will shy away but, if you kept on trying to pet him he would likely bite. I mean would you like to have strangers come up and start touching you? No way.  I was at the park and this group of kids kept coming over and trying to pet him. I told them no twice. My dog was already uncomfortable and clearly did not like it. We finally pulled away. I had to pee so I tied him up to the post near the door. He's a good boy so I know he wouldn't bark or run off. Next thing I know I hear a scream.   The kid got bit. After I told him 3x do not touch my dog he goes and tries to pet him.  The kid isnt bleeding much just a small nip. My dog is freaked out and cowering. An adult comes by and calls animal control citing \"The dog is aggressive and dangerous and viciously attacked a child\".  AC come by and so do the Parents. AC take my dog away for testing for rabies; and the Mom is angry. The kid says he went to pet my dog and the dog lunged at him and tried taking his hand off. I know that's a lie because, my dog is well trained and has never bit anyone or shown signs of aggression. Dogs dont just randomly go crazy. He does like being pet and I told that kid he doesn't so dont pet him.  The Mom is sobbing and saying she wants my \"vicious\" dog put to sleep because, he's a danger to everyone around him.  She ignored everything I said regarding me warning the kid not too pet him.  I'm just frazzled right now. My dog is currently being detained and I dont know if he'll be coming back. All he did was nip a kid who wouldnt take no for an answer.  What is my next step? I want to act fast before she takes legal action and to protect my dog.","__index_level_0__":17538}

As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both.            My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population.             When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences.                      I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying).               Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle.

{"post_id":"8wmtdi","history":"CMV, a yellow card during in a football game should be followed by a 10 minutes suspension. Having a yellow card during a soccer game has almost no impact on the game. In my opinion, the rules and the fact that there was no VAR until now encourages situations in which players will fake an injury (yes, I just saw Mbapp\u00e9 faking) to get a free kick. The only result, if the player is caught red handed as Mbapp\u00e9 was, is at worst a yellow card and the game will go on. It is also true for rough plays on certain players (for example, Griezmann has been a target during the whole game against Argentina, and except for one yellow card, there was almost no  punishment).  Having a 10 minutes suspension like in rugby would really penalize the whole team which would need to run more and get tired faster. This would really discourage foul plays and would both protect the players and their health from tough plays and eliminate the aspect of soccer that every afficionado hates: simulation.","__index_level_0__":16320}

It's selfish not to.  **2- WHAT ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELEIFS**- Does your religious beliefs also require you to not accept a donated organ and instead go to the afterlife? Or is this a case of My body is too sacred to save someone else, but someone else body can be used to save me!  If it's the former then fine you have a fair point and a consistent view that the body after death caries significance and thus should not be messed with. Thus you will follow that to your grave.  If its the later you have no standing, and your argument is full of crap, you can't have it both ways, either the body is important to the soul and thus must be left alone and so taking part of someone's body to heal yourself if sacrilegious or its not.  **3- PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN BODY**- Correct in life, not in death to value the dead over the living is immoral. To say that because you have died someone else should die is antithetical to the very notion of morality.  **4- SO YOU THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE BLOOD TOO?**- All able bodied healthy adults who can give blood should when called upon.

The long-term project ended up taking a lot longer to complete due to some unexpected results, but is now nearing completion. As a result, I have not been able to work as much on the project I am actually paid off of. During this time, my interest in an academic career has pretty much gone to zero and I have decided that industry aligns better with my goals.   I wasn't planning on applying for jobs right now, but an industry job was posted in January that aligns extremely well with my scientific skills and personal career interests, so I applied for it. I initially did not tell my PI, but later told him because he eventually would find out I applied because he is close with all of my references.   He was happy for me at first, but then told me that I need to either find a new job within the next 5 months (so he can hire a replacement), or commit to staying on the project until the funding is complete (2 more years).

While i did enjoy these jobs,they were also very exhausting as I pretty much had to keep a rambunctious group of children entertained all day, as well as making sure that they didn't kill themselves or each other.

These jobs were also very exhausting due to heavy lifting, assembling confusing patio furniture, working outside during one of my hometown's hottest summers on record, and dealing with shitty customers.

Hi everyone, I am currently finishing my master's in electrical engineering am trying to think of what type of PhD I want and what sort of cool things I could maybe do with it. For my undergraduate I double majored in both electrical and mechanical engineering and minored in computer science. Then I started my MSEE and am considering many different areas for a PhD. I considered electrical, but I kind of want to broaden my abilities even further and go for a PhD in something else - maybe particle physics (maybe CERN?) or systems engineering.  Anyways, what sorts of cool jobs or fields could I involve myself in given my background assuming I had a PhD in said fields?

For example how do you manage to:   * Cook  * Shopping for groceries.   * Clean home, laundry  * Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes  * Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation.   * Maintaining a pet: if you have one.   * Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.   * Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.   * Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.   * Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on.   * Other chores that are skipping me at the moment.

{"post_id":"9um4wx","history":"Dealing with students' unrealistic expectations about their grades and education in general (in US) I am a PhD student at a decent school in US, I am also a long time teaching assistant (my fifth year) and for all these years, the class that I was a TA for has been about the same subject, which is also my research topic. My interactions with students are my weekly office hours and grading their exams and assignments. This is where the problem begins: After every homework or exam that I grade, many students come challenging their grades by saying a variation of (i) \"My answer is same as the solution manual but I didn't get full credit.\", (ii) \"My solution is correct and solution manual is wrong.\" or (iii) \"My solution is same as my friend's but my grade is lower.\"  Aside Info: Even if the subject (taught at this level) is not really mathematical -other than being able to do primary school operations on numbers and comparing them with each other-, I guess it requires some sort of mathematical maturity to avoid fallacies. So answers to each question requires a \"proof,\" even though it is usually a one-liner but the students often lack the background to do it, which is somewhat surprising since most of them are seniors with some juniors at a good university.  I don't know the institutional reasons for the lack of background of the students and I understand that it may not be their fault that they were allowed to take this class without the proper background. However, I cannot possibly teach them proof techniques or basic logic either. I mean, they don't even need to write technical proofs, I just need a decently complete arguments about why some simple statement is true or false. To make this easier for them, I always write very clear solutions to each question after they submit their work, explain it step by step and show\/argue that if you omit even one step, the answer would be incomplete.  Here is an example that illustrates the type of answers I get very often: \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd.\" (The actual subject concerns much simpler problems but this shows the type of fallacies I deal with on a daily basis.) Then, they argue that they deserve full credit, since they rightfully argued that \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd\".  I explain that their end result might be correct but their method is not; that this class is all about teaching the methods, and finally that the question explicitly requires an explanation which should be correct for the answer to be considered correct, hence they don't deserve full credit for it. (I feel embarrassed that I need to say things like this since it feels like an insult to their intelligence; if the question is not a multiple choice or \"Fill in the black\", these should be fairly obvious. Yet, I dealt with this for years now.) Then, they complain to the professor about this. I talk to the professor about it and we have a good laugh. (I don't remember any instance where a professor sided with the students about this issue and the professors are some of the top people in this field in the world so at this point I am fairly confident about my grading system.) This process repeats itself every week, every year.  I am sorry, I haven't had chance to rant about this in a while so I got a little carried away while trying to give some background. So, is there a systematic solution to my problem? What are your suggestions? I think I will suggest to the professor that we upload a practice problem set with the detailed solutions next term before the deadline for the first homework to set their expectations about our expectations but I don't know if this will work.

{"post_id":"4zb890","history":"[AK] After an ugly 4 yr long custody battle, I have not seen my children for 3 years. I just found out that my 12 year old son is dying from cancer, and my ex is refusing me access to medical information and visits to my child. I apologize in advance, there is no easy way to explain this story, this will be a wall of text. I will endeavor to keep it as brief and relevant as possible.   I was married for 10 years to a narcissistic, abusive, sociopath. Most of the abuse leveled at me was emotional\/intimidation, but he was physically abusive to my daughter from a previous relationship, and our three sons. When I moved out, he physically attacked me, nearly breaking my arm and causing extensive soft tissue damage. This is relevant later.   In 2005, our oldest son died of leukemia. He was 2. In 2009, our middle son was diagnosed with lymphoma. He successfully completed treatment and has been in remission for nearly 7 years.   We separated in 2009, right after my sons treatment was finished, and filed for divorce shortly after. I filed a DV report when he attacked me. He hired a criminal defense attorney, absolutely assassinated my character, convinced my mother to testify against me, as well as our blind elderly neighbor who \"saw\" the entire incident. The case was dropped.   During the divorce hearing, I filed for full custody. In Alaska, in most cases, that automatically guarantees the other parent will get custody (if they are asking for 50\/50 joint custody). I did not know this at the time, and my lawyer pushed for full because of the DV hearing. The judge reviewed the files\/recording, decided on the spot I was a liar because the other case was dropped, and awarded joint custody.   For four years, my ex dragged me back to court for every excuse he could find, to complain about my unwillingness to cooperate and co-parent with him. He paid a counselor (a substantial cash payment, outside of our insurance coverage, with additional gifts such as fishing trips and work done to his property) to testify against me in court. I did not find out until much later that the counselor was practicing with a suspended license for ethics violations (false testimony in other family court cases) the entire time he was \"treating\" my children. Every time we went to court, I lost more and more rights\/privileges.   In 2013, he filed multiple abuse investigations with OCS, culminating in a police investigation and restraining orders being filed against me after I returned my children to him with bruises (bruises were NOT from abuse, the children stated that, OCS stated that, and the doctor that examined them stated there was no way to conclude they were the result of abuse). However, I did admit in court to spanking my children, with my hand, 1 time over the week the bruising occurred.   By this time, the judge was not even bothering to hide her disgust for me every time we came to court. She stated that in the case of the spanking, it was a violation of the no corporal punishment clause in our divorce decree (true), that my children were in fear for their lives because they behaved immediately afterward, and that the spanking met the definition of assault. She granted a one year protective order against me, ordered parenting classes, a domestic violence intervention program, mandatory counseling, and reduced my visitation to 6 supervised hours per week, with a supervisor of my ex's choosing.   I completed all ordered services. My ex, however, refused to comply with the visitation. Or rather, he made visitation so logistically and physically impossible, he might as well have refused. He always made it clear that when I could not meet his conditions, it was MY refusal to comply, not him denying access.   With the help of my counselor, I made the decision to walk away. This entire situation was a narcissists dream - he maintained all control and could \"punish\" me for leaving through my children. By removing myself from the power struggle, even knowing that he was not a good person, or a good parent, the hope was he would drop his obsession for controlling me, and focus on raising our boys in a healthier atmosphere. It is the hardest decision I have ever made in my life.   I did get behind in child support for some time, as I had a hard time finding work. But it was paid whenever I was working, and not only has it been paid consistently for nearly two years but all of my arrearages have long since caught up. I have had absolutely zero contact with my ex or my children in just over three years.   I found out over the weekend that my 12 year old son, after being in remission for 7 years, has relapsed, and is in very poor condition. At 12, my son weighs 56 lbs. he has always been a small child, but he is the size of an average 6-7 year old. My ex so stubbornly refused to take him to the doctor, despite OBVIOUS signs of illness, including a tennis ball sized mass on his chest, that when the cancer spread to his spine and began putting so much pressure on his brain that he is exhibiting stroke symptoms (face drooping, balance issues, slurred speech), my ex still sent him to school, and the school had to intervene and refuse to allow him back until he had a doctors clearance. My younger son is also displaying some rather alarming signs of abuse\/mistreatment.   At this point, their father still refuses to contact me to tell me about our sons health. He is blocking my attempts to access medical records or speak with the doctors. He has told others that if I try to go to the hospital he will have me arrested (he can't, but he can cause a huge scene and upset my son).   I have applied to legal aid previously, and was denied - custody cases are rarely given assistance by legal aid here. I cannot afford an attorney. I pay 52% of my income to child support. I barely eat, but I will do whatever I have to to support my kids.   I know I need to speak with an attorney. I have left messages for several that friends have referred me to in the hopes that one will consider a pro bono representation, or allow some sort of payment arrangements. Other than that, any advice on how to proceed at this point, or resources in Alaska I may not have found, would be greatly appreciated.","__index_level_0__":18298}

{"post_id":"nawmm1","history":"Do philosophers believe that consciousness inherently unmeasurable? Why would or wouldn't it be? The fact that I can type \"I experience consciousness\" is proof that my consciousness can affect the physical universe. It's also obviously affected by the physical universe. Is it then not just a part of the physical universe? And if it's part of the physical universe, how could it be inherently unmeasurable?  I heard an argument in a TED talk that compared consciousness to life. It was thought centuries ago that life was an immeasurable force that we would never understand. And nowadays, we understand the chemical processes of life pretty well thanks to things like microscopes etc.  This argument at first didn't appeal to me, for two reasons. One was that the chemical process of life is very different than our experience of consciousness. And another one was that I didn't think it would necessarily be reasonable for a person in history to assume life is a set of chemical reactions given lack of evidence, and therefore it may be unreasonable for a modern person to assume something similar about consciousness.  But then I began to think on it further, and I no longer think such a theory of life would have been so unreasonable. I think an especially wise person back in history could have postulated that things life water flowing, freezing, melting is some kind of \"small scale life,\" followed by a process like fire being slightly \"more alive,\" followed by molds, then plants, then animals. Of course water isn't alive, but all of these are chemical processes with increasing complexity. And similarly, I think looking at machines of the day like mills would have been able to give a wise person the idea that life is machinery -- this is actually pretty apparent with things like the watchmaker argument.  Another example that comes to mind is color. I could imagine that there were once people who may have argued that color is not measurable -- like how red something is. Maybe this is a strawman, and that nobody ever argued this. But I certainly do find it fantastic that color is now very very measurable due to our understanding of the wavelengths of light. I feel like a reasonable person otherwise could be convinced that color is inherently subjective in the way we nowadays argue that pain and happiness is inherently subjective.  I think the argument for life applies to consciousness. I am most familiar with my own, but I have good reason to believe everyone else is too. And to a lesser degree, I can be pretty confident that my dog is conscious. Down to bugs perhaps less so. Plants could be, they do move to follow the sun. Bacteria could be barely conscious too. Looking at it from this lens, it seems sort of absurd to say consciousness has an arbitrary cutoff point where it suddenly arises in fish or whatever.  Is it not reasonable to imagine that we merely lack the instruments to measure it? That perhaps one day, I'll be able to experience another beings consciousness directly thanks to technology? And perhaps be able to answer fundamental questions like \"do we see red the same way or just call it by the same name?\" Is the lack of a current technology that can do this a good argument that we won't be able to in the future?  Of course, it would be naive of me to think that this is a novel line of thinking. I'm curious, do philosophers believe that consciousness is fundamentally unmeasurable? And reasons are given on either side of that argument?","__index_level_0__":10236}

{"post_id":"sgcxas","history":"How do people just seem to \"know\" what certain jobs or industries pay in engineering? In my experience in engineering, engineers *love* to talk about what other engineers make. I think the fact that 3\/4 of the discussion on this sub boils down to that will attest, and it happens often at the jobs I've had. I've had a variety of jobs in different industries and roles myself over about a decade of working.  I come from a blue collar background, so I was never inherently familiar with salary negotiation and white collar career growth. A decade out, I've come to notice that the people who progress faster in their career are the ones who have this sixth sense for career growth, when it's time to move, what industries are hot, and things like that. We've all seen examples of someone clearly disconnected from that sixth sense - \"I'm an EE doing embedded systems for 10 years making $65k, is that good\"? And I think I'm aware enough to know ballpark numbers of what's reasonable. But I'm interested in the people who seem to be experts at it.  Both on this sub, and in real life networking, I'll hear phrases like \"Check out Parker Hannifin, they can't hire people fast enough!\" or \"Try Boeing's electronics division, starting salary $130k, minimum\" or \"my buddy tells me 3M is starting a new location in Pennsylvania, they're desperate for people, I heard numbers like $120k being thrown around\" or \"with your experience, you should be getting $150k at least\".  These phrases are usually worded and said with the utmost confidence. And I've always wondered, where do these people get all this information? I thought the general conclusion was that Glassdoor lowballs salaries, just because it doesn't update for inflation or new market conditions. If they're talking with a friend or professional contact who's an engineer, without being the manager or the one hiring, it's very likely that they don't have the full context of what the personnel ramp up or salary range is. In the end, it seems like these confident proclamations essentially come down to anecdotal hearsay.  I did listen to a connection who told me that ASML was ramping up and that it would be a big jump for me. I interviewed and got a job offer from them...and it was within a couple of percent of what I already make. I renegotiated and they said that was the range for the position, and I didn't end up taking it.  I'm so fascinated in this subject because as we know, engineers tend not to be the type to be social butterflies, gossiping at parties about who's dating who. But the second salary and career progression comes up at work, I've seen absolute 180s in personalities and everyone seems to have a buddy who's making 150k-175k here or has salary\/bonuses that blow us out of the water, and be unusually confident about how correct their \"map\" of compensation and salaries for engineers are.  I'm wondering where do these people get this information? Even after being an engineer for over a decade, I've never given my opinion on this subject because I don't know any of this stuff for sure. I'd feel embarrassed speaking with such certainty about something that I feel should actually come with many caveats. My personal career is winding and unique. People exaggerate or underrepresent what they make. But in any discussion about engineering salary, there's no shortage of people giving their 2 cents. Where do they get this information? Is there some secret Glassdoor alternative I don't know about? Is it just a natural effect where the people who are most self-confident are the ones who are more likely to speak up? Should a certain percentage of my week be spent networking with the goal of getting salary information and building a \"map\" of what different job functions and industries pay?

I intially tried to get him to move with me for my MS, but he wasn't ready for that at the time, his mother was very ill and he couldn't be too far from her, but now she has passed on, so I'm not sure why he's reluctant to move. He seems to not want to find a new job, which is odd to me. His job is very good for his level of education ($40K per year lab tech and he never went to college), and he some ambition for part of it, but on the other hand he hates certain parts of it and complains about the company being racist towards him and not letting him get the attention he needs to advance his career.

{"post_id":"68l3y1","history":"CMV: Universal basic income will, in the long term, entrench inequality When the  subject of a universal basic income (UBI) comes up, people often give the same arguments: it will reduce poverty; it will make welfare more efficient by simplifying administration; and it will make labour fairer by providing an alternative to either starving or getting trapped in a cycle of low-paid exploitative jobs.  Critics tend to say that UBI will make people lazy by removing the incentive to work, that it's useless because companies will simply pass on any loss in profits to consumers, or that the money just doesn't exist for it.  Personally, I think that UBI would probably be fairly effective at accomplishing its aims, and that while it might disrupt our society significantly we would adapt. I think the resulting society might even be better for the poorest. Feel free to challenge this, but it's not really my main argument.  I'm concerned that if UBI is implemented, it would, in the long term, entrench inequality. Here are my assumptions:  1. The biggest inequality is between those that earn money through capital and those that earn money by wages. The majority of people will never earn enough money through a salary to rival those who own lots of capital. UBI wouldn't change this, because the gap to be closed is orders of magnitude too large. 3. UBI would, presumably, be largely paid for by the rich, but won't be so damaging to accumulated wealth that the inequality between labour and capital reduces significantly. If UBI cost enough to do this, I don't see how it could be sustainable once those fortunes are exhausted. At that point, society would be forcibly redistributing capital, which is a lot further than most people are willing to go. 2. Income from UBI would largely be spent on the same things most people's salary already goes towards: rent (or a mortgage), food, and so on. Either UBI makes a big difference to a person, in which case it will likely go towards essentials, or it's just an extra supplement on top of a satisfactory salary---nice to have, but not going to make a person rich.  So inequality remains, albeit hopefully with the reduction or disappearance of abject poverty. The rich continue to get richer because people still need to pay them for food and rent and so on, and the poor are slightly less poor. People are generally more comfortable, so the risk of revolution lowers and politicians are placed under less pressure to further reduce inequality. Inequality between capital and labour is already higher than it was on the eve of WWI, and there is no reason to think that it will reduce or even level off without any external factors.  I imagine that it's obvious from the question that I'm no economist, so please keep your answers accessible for a layperson. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

{"post_id":"ec5rbx","history":"Discovered a blatant case of a colleague plagiarizing my work. What do I do? I agreed to peer review an opinion\/review paper for a journal. No authors or institutions were listed as the journal wanted to blind us. As I was reading it, I increasingly felt like huge chunks of the the text were oddly familiar.   Turns out the author copied paragraphs of text verbatim from a separate project that I\u2019m involved with and wrote the background for. Same text, same references, everything. The project details are not publicly available yet, so only the project team has had access to this document along with select reviewers. Additionally I found text copied from email correspondences that I had with a few team members in the manuscript and were portrayed as this individual\u2019s commentary, so I\u2019m pretty confident I know who this person is now.  To make things even more absurd, I previously reviewed a paper where the suspected individual was the lead author (was not blinded for that one) and noticed the background section was copied from another online resource. I let the editor know about this issue at the time and advised that the section be revised and cite back to the online resource. At the time I tried to give this person the benefit of the doubt so left it at that.  I now have two occurrences over a short time frame where this person has plagiarized text and I\u2019ve caught them. This second time they plagiarized me for about 50% of the manuscript and I\u2019m really mad. This person is at a different institution, but I\u2019m going to have to interact with this person frequently through this project and our field generally. I guarantee this is an ongoing pattern\/behavior and will continue until someone steps in. This individual has also completed more than enough training and published several times to know how wrong all of this is. I\u2019m now also concerned they\u2019ve likely used material from me and others for other grants\/projects they\u2019ve been working on as well.  We are going to notify the journal about what happened, but what other steps should be taken? This is just so egregious. I can\u2019t just let this die with the journal and pave the way for it to happen again with a different journal, review panel, etc. This person is young and I don\u2019t want to end their career, but they need a serious intervention and some sort of consequences for their actions...ugh.","__index_level_0__":789}

{"post_id":"5496sn","history":"[Captain America: Civil War; The Avengers: Age of Ultron] Given what was done to Sokovia, shouldn't the total monetary loss be more than $474 billion? How is it calculated? I'm speaking exclusively and nearly from a monetary standpoint; as in, the amount of loss would not be offset by the benefit to the world, because if it were, then \"Total loss\" would literally be positive infinity, when you consider that the avengers literally prevented the extinction of the human race and likely the extinction of just about every animal but maybe cockroaches and frogs.   $474 billion just seems so...small when you consider the literal disintegration of an entire nation state -- however small The country is in terms of surface area, political power, GDP, and population.  I would put it on par with actual Eastern European countries that are small yet war-torn, perhaps something like Kazakhstan or even a smaller version of Turkey.  All of those buildings, homes, businesses, and just general real estate with possible oil's and minerals and other commodities that could be mined have to be worth more than half a billion dollars.  If you consider GDP and total job loss, along with displacement costs and worldwide relief aid, it has to be more than $474 billion, right?  Even if they don't calculate the speculative and in tangible, like I said, the physical structures and properties and fissile material have to be worth a ton more when combined.   **So, how do you suppose they calculate the damage or \"total loss\"?**    Because the incident in **LAGOS was $14 million** -- and I have to believe that the building alone couldn't have been worth more than $14 million in Africa, since labor and materials would come cheaply -- do they use human lives to factor that in?  Not just casualties, but injuries and psychological distress?  If so, the Sokovia total loss would have to be at least somewhere close to $1 trillion. Even with, say, 3 million citizens, they're all displaced and have forever lost their homes -- not just their dwellings but their actual nation (**imagine if the US -- or your country of origin -- were completely vaporized, with zero time to prepare to capture the history. That would make my heart hurt. People's hearts ache over the loss of their childhood home not even due to demolition but just the view of a new family inside it -- imagine the feeling of seeing your entire hometown, your home *nation* being \"demolished\" and forever unable to revisit.**)  I feel like the \"cost\" of the total \"pain\" (PTSD, emotional distress, nostalgia, etc) would be very high (3 million people multiplied $50,000, an arbitrary number for  ***no*** precedence has been set, since you can't imagine how a Sokovian must feel not being able to even visit their hometown, not just home). That would be $150 billion already...and $50,000 is not even that high of an amount.   Then, add in the costs of housing \"refugees\" (or whatever a displaced citizen is called) via World Aid\/Relief, which could be calculated even at $25,000 per person, if would be $75 billion.   **So $225 billion in just total cost of \"pain\" and \"relief\" -- not even counting tangible costs.**  **1) How do you think they calculate Total Loss and 2) how do you think they *should* calculate Total Loss?**","__index_level_0__":13997}
{"post_id":"cecwp9","history":"CMV: Any job paying under a certain wage, or simply the federal minimum wage, should be barred from conducting criminal background and credit checks. Poverty and crime are two closely linked concepts. While not everyone who is poor is involved in criminal activity, and likewise the other direction, many who are poor do in fact have records. Drug addiction and mental health issues, in addition to desperate poverty, contribute to criminal records.  The solution to poverty is money, and one way to get money is by working a decent job. However, criminal records keep many of those in extreme poverty from decent employment.  Recently, some jobs have started doing credit checks--presumably because things like eviction and financial trouble can cause an employee to miss days of work. In general, I think this should be illegal, but it should be especially illegal in jobs paying under a certain amount.  Employment standards that come from a place of privilege for jobs that serve workers who are far from privileged must come to an end if we hope to see any real change around poverty in the United States.","__index_level_0__":16182}

{"post_id":"b3dhm4","history":"Newly adopted dog refuses to leave hiding spot to go potty Sorry, this is a long post!  I'm at a loss of how to help our new pup. We adopted Mackenzie 15 weeks ago from a shelter. They think she's about 2.5-3 years old. She had a horrible past, they found her in a sewage drain with a litter of her own puppies when she was about ten months old. They were able to adopt out the puppies, but she was left behind in the shelter. They told me that they often had to trick and force her to go back into the kennel after her outside time was over.  The first time we met her we couldn't touch her because of how skittish she was. Now, she's gotten a ton better since then and will cuddle on the bed and even greet some of the people that come into the house. It's been a remarkable improvement that I didn't expect to happen for a very long time. However, we're dealing with another issue that I'm worried will affect her physical health.   She's still scared of many things like being outside at night and the lights going on or off inside, and she might be scared of doorways. We\u2019re having some problems interpreting all her behavior.Unfortunately, because of this, she likes to hide in her kennel or the side of the bed. This would be fine, except that she doesn't want to leave the hiding spot to go potty (even during the day time) and she isn't going potty in the house either. We can't bribe her to come out with treats or lure her out with the neighbor's dog inside the house for play time (she loves playing with this dog outside). We've tried putting her on a double leash with our other dog so they walk together to the door, but she won't even stand up. So we have to pick her up and carry or pull her out of the spot and bring her outside. I know this is traumatic for her, but I don't know what else to do. It would be easier if she would just pee inside, but she won't. We tried waiting her out and leaving the door open to see if she'd go outside on her own, but after 12 hours hours we have to force her out. We once waited until 18 hours, but she won't go outside. Once she is outside, she's happy. She runs around and plays with the other dogs. We give lots of treats and play time.  When she's indoors she will leave her spots for food, water, and attention, but when we move to open the door she hides again. Sometimes when we approach her outside of her hiding spots she will run away from us, other times she wags her tail and waits for pets.  I know we're making it worse by forcing the transition, but I'm worried if we just keep waiting it out that she'll have bladder problems. My husband wants to block off her hiding spots, but I don't want to take away the places she feels safe. We have been doing confidence building activities and lots of positive association with her known fears, but it isn't working fast enough for her to transition from her safe space to outside on her own and each time we force it I think we make it worse.    We have a vet appointment to try to get some anxiety meds, but have been denied medication before with our other dog (severe separation anxiety that was unable to be worked through with a professional behaviorist) from two vets that said they won\u2019t give anxiety medication to dogs. It has since been explained the me that it\u2019s a cultural belief (I live in Italy). If I get denied again is there another way to help her? I can also get Trazadone and Xanax from the human pharmacy without a prescription, but \u201cself\u201d medicating sounds like a horrible idea that could go really wrong.","__index_level_0__":14491}

It is probably something to do with protecting their offspring, but it seems to me that they still have predators that hunt their offspring fairly easily where they hatch\/lay their eggs, so maybe there is another reason as well?","__index_level_0__":16594}
